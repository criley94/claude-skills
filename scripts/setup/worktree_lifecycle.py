"""Worktree-lifecycle helper for the architect-team plugin (v1.2.0 + v1.3.0 + v3.6.0).

v1.1.0 shipped `scripts/setup/worktree_paths.py` — the worktree-aware
state-resolution sibling that answers WHERE state lives (shared vs. per-run).
v1.2.0 ships THIS module — the side-effecting lifecycle helper that CREATES,
DETECTS, and TEARS DOWN architect-team-run worktrees, so the three pipeline
slash commands (`/architect-team`, `/architect-team:bug-fix`,
`/architect-team:mini`) can auto-create a worktree by default before invoking
the pipeline skill. v1.3.0 extends the module with two auto-cleanup helpers
(`list_merged_architect_team_worktrees`, `cleanup_merged_worktrees`) so the
same slash commands can sweep merged-and-forgotten worktrees from prior runs
as their first action.

The split is intentional: `worktree_paths.py` is pure read-only resolution
(no side effects); `worktree_lifecycle.py` runs `git worktree add` /
`git worktree remove` / `git branch -d` subprocesses. Keeping the two
responsibilities in separate modules preserves the v1.1.0 path-resolution
module's pure-resolution contract and keeps the lifecycle helper independently
testable.

Public API — six stdlib-only functions:

  create_run_worktree(slug, base_branch="main", parent_dir=None) -> Path
      Create `<parent>/<repo-name>-<slug>/` on a fresh branch
      `architect-team/<slug>`. Handles slug/branch collisions by appending
      `-2`, `-3`, ... Returns the absolute path to the new worktree.

  cleanup_run_worktree(worktree_path, remove_branch=False) -> None
      `git worktree remove <path>` (idempotent). When `remove_branch=True`,
      also `git branch -d architect-team/<slug>` (slug derived from the path
      basename's trailing suffix).

  current_worktree_is_run() -> bool
      True iff `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` starts with
      `architect-team/`. Used by the slash commands' re-entry detection so
      they do not double-nest a worktree when invoked from inside an
      existing run worktree.

  current_run_slug() -> str | None
      The part after `architect-team/` of the current branch name when in a
      run worktree, else None.

  list_merged_architect_team_worktrees(against="origin/main", exclude_current=True, include_squash_merged=False) -> list[Path]
      (v1.3.0) Return paths of architect-team/* worktrees whose branch is
      merged into <against>. Excludes the current worktree by default
      (safety: don't auto-remove the cwd even if its branch happens to be
      merged). Branches NOT starting with `architect-team/` are never
      considered. (lineage P6 / REQ-CDL-11a) When `include_squash_merged=True`,
      the squash-aware predicate `_branch_is_merged_or_squash_merged` is used so
      squash-merged branches are also recognized; default False keeps the
      conservative `merge-base --is-ancestor` behavior (the documented v1.3.0
      safe false-negative for squash merges).

  cleanup_merged_worktrees(against="origin/main", dry_run=False, include_squash_merged=False) -> list[Path]
      (v1.3.0) Remove all merged architect-team/* worktrees. Returns paths
      cleaned (or that would-be-cleaned in dry_run mode). Idempotent on a
      worktree that disappears between list and remove. (lineage P6 /
      REQ-CDL-11a) `include_squash_merged=True` opts in to squash-merge
      detection via `_branch_is_merged_or_squash_merged`; default False
      preserves today's plain-ancestor-only behavior.

  finalize_run_worktree(worktree_path=None, against="origin/main", branch=None) -> dict
      (v3.6.0) End-of-run merge check: remove the run's worktree + branch
      when its `architect-team/<slug>` branch is already merged into
      <against>; otherwise leave the worktree intact and return a persistence
      warning naming the path + the manual cleanup command. Best-effort: any
      subprocess failure is reflected in the returned dict rather than raised.

  list_run_branches(against="origin/main", remote="origin", include_squash_merged=False) -> list[dict]
      (v3.7.0 auto-merge-to-main) Enumerate every local `architect-team/*`
      branch and, for each, report `{branch, worktree_path, merged_into_main,
      squash_merged, cleanly_mergeable}`. Powers the startup
      branch-reconciliation prompt. Non-`architect-team/*` branches are never
      included; best-effort `[]`. (lineage P6 / REQ-CDL-11a) The `squash_merged`
      field is always populated (`_branch_is_squash_merged`); when
      `include_squash_merged=True` a branch counts as merged-for-cleanup if it is
      EITHER a plain ancestor OR squash-merged, default False keeps the
      conservative plain-ancestor-only treatment.

  recommend_worktree(task_scope=None) -> dict
      (lineage P6 / REQ-CDL-11b) Advisory-only heuristic returning
      `{"use_worktree": bool, "reason": str}` for whether the auto-worktree
      default should fire for a task of the given scope. Tiny / trivial /
      doc-only / single-file scopes recommend False; small..large / feature /
      multi-file / None recommend True. ADVISORY ONLY — `--no-worktree` is
      always honored regardless of this recommendation, and the default when
      `task_scope` is None stays True (today's behavior).

  merge_branch_to_main_and_prune(branch, worktree_path=None, against="main", remote="origin", push=True) -> dict
      (v3.7.0 auto-merge-to-main) Merge a cleanly-mergeable
      `architect-team/<slug>` branch into <against>, push, delete the branch
      (local + remote), and remove its worktree — ONLY when it merges cleanly.
      Conflicts are skipped + reported (never forced); a rejected push (branch
      protection) stops pruning and leaves the work recoverable (never
      --force). Best-effort: returns a dict, never raises.

Squash-merge detection (lineage P6 / REQ-CDL-11a)
-------------------------------------------------

The default merged-probe `_branch_is_merged_into` uses
`git merge-base --is-ancestor`, which MISSES squash-merges: a squash merge
replays the branch's net diff as a SINGLE NEW commit on <against>, so the
original branch tip is never an ancestor of <against>. The opt-in
`include_squash_merged=True` flag (on `list_run_branches`,
`cleanup_merged_worktrees`, and `list_merged_architect_team_worktrees`) swaps
in the squash-aware predicate `_branch_is_merged_or_squash_merged`.

`_branch_is_squash_merged` is deliberately CONSERVATIVE — it must never flag a
branch that still has genuinely-unmerged work. A branch counts as
squash-merged iff (a) it has >= 1 commit beyond the merge-base with <against>
(otherwise there is nothing to judge) AND (b) it is NOT already a plain
ancestor (that is the normal-merge path; this predicate strictly ADDS the
squash case) AND (c) the branch's net diff is already fully present in
<against>, probed via `git diff --quiet <against>..<branch>` exiting 0 (the
branch tip tree contributes no net change over <against>). The probe is the
two-dot tip-vs-tip form, not three-dot: after a squash merge the branch's
merge-base with <against> is unchanged, so three-dot `<against>...<branch>`
would still show the branch's own changes and false-negative every squash —
exactly the case this exists to catch. Any subprocess error returns False — on
ambiguity we never delete unmerged work. The default
(`include_squash_merged=False`) keeps today's plain-ancestor-only behavior, the
documented v1.3.0 safe false-negative.

Naming conventions
------------------

- Branch: `architect-team/<slug>` (matches the existing Phase 8
  default-branch-guard convention).
- Worktree directory (v3.6.0): `<parent-of-repo>/.<repo-name>-worktrees/<slug>/`
  — a single hidden per-project container collects every run worktree (e.g.
  repo at `/Users/foo/projects/myapp` with slug `add-billing` -> worktree at
  `/Users/foo/projects/.myapp-worktrees/add-billing/`). The old flat layout
  `<parent>/<repo-name>-<slug>/` is still recognized by cleanup +
  slug-derivation for backward compatibility with pre-v3.6.0 on-disk
  worktrees.
- Collision handling: if EITHER the path OR the branch already exists, the
  helper appends `-2`, then `-3`, ... until both are free.

Reuse Decision: RD-1 (build-new — no existing equivalent). Stdlib only,
matching the convention used by `scripts/setup/worktree_paths.py` (the
sibling resolution helper) and `scripts/setup/teams_mode.py` (the existing
setup helper this module sits alongside).

    `OSError` (e.g. git binary missing) is NOT swallowed here — callers that

    (`cleanup_merged_worktrees` / `list_merged_architect_team_worktrees`,

    the SAME published ref the sweep prunes against, and a branch already
    landed on `origin/main` via a GitHub PR merge is correctly seen as merged
    (a stale local `main` would have missed it). This is the deliberate split
    in the module's API: the "is it already merged / safe to prune?" checks
    (`list_run_branches`, the sweep, `finalize_run_worktree`) judge against the
    PUBLISHED `origin/main`, whereas `merge_branch_to_main_and_prune` /
    `_branch_cleanly_mergeable` operate against LOCAL `main` because that is the
    ref `git checkout main && git merge` actually integrates into. Callers run

    `_branch_is_merged_or_squash_merged` so a squash-merged branch is reported

    `<against>` and `_branch_is_merged_into` returns False even though the work
    is fully present. This predicate fills exactly that gap, and ONLY that gap.

    Conservative — must never flag a branch that still has genuinely-unmerged
    work. A branch is squash-merged iff ALL of:
      (a) it has >= 1 commit beyond the merge-base with `<against>` (otherwise
          there is nothing to judge -> False);
      (b) it is NOT already a plain ancestor of `<against>` (that is the
          normal-merge path; this predicate strictly ADDS the squash case
          -> False when already a plain ancestor);
      (c) the branch's net diff is already fully present in `<against>` —

          tip-tree-vs-tip-tree comparison). Exit 0 means the branch tip tree
          contributes NO net change over `<against>` -> nothing left to merge
          -> effectively merged (incl. squash). Exit 1 means there IS un-merged
          work -> False.

    Implementation note on (c): the requirement framed this as "the net diff
    the branch would contribute is already present in <against>". The two-dot
    `<against>..<branch>` form is the probe that actually expresses this in
    git's model. After a squash merge, the branch tip is NOT a descendant of
    `<against>` and their merge-base is the ORIGINAL pre-squash commit, so the
    three-dot `<against>...<branch>` form still shows the branch's own changes
    (its merge-base hasn't moved) and would FALSE-NEGATIVE every squash — i.e.
    it never detects the case this function exists to detect. Two-dot compares
    the two tip trees directly, so it is empty exactly when the branch's work is
    already reflected in `<against>` (the squash-merge signature). Guard (a)
    keeps an all-revert / no-op branch from being mistaken for squash-merged by
    requiring real commits beyond the merge-base; guard (b) reserves the plain-
    ancestor case for the normal-merge predicate.

    Any subprocess error / indeterminate probe returns False — on ambiguity we
    never treat a branch as merged (so we never delete unmerged work).
