"""Canonical boilerplate-block text for architect-team agent files.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for three byte-identical boilerplate sections that are
duplicated across the ~30 ``agents/*.md`` files:

* ``## Forbidden git operations``   (v1.6.0 discipline)
* ``## Checkpoint discipline``      (v1.8.0 discipline)
* ``## Operating context (v1.0.0)`` (the shared teammate-context paragraph)

This module is **stdlib-only and has no import-time side effects**. It exposes:

* ``BLOCKS`` -- a dict keyed by block id, each value carrying the ``heading``,
  the ``canonical`` text, the ``match`` mode, the list of ``standard_agents``
  that must carry the canonical form, and the ``variant_agents`` that are
  explicitly ALLOWLISTED as carrying a deliberately different (role-specific)
  form and are therefore NOT required to match the canonical text.
* ``extract_block(text, heading)`` -- pull a single ``## ``-delimited block out
  of an agent file's text (universal-newline form), returning the heading line
  through the last non-blank line before the next ``## `` heading, or ``None``
  if the heading is absent.
* ``read_agent_text(path)`` -- read an agent file with universal-newline
  translation so CRLF (the on-disk Windows working-tree form) and LF compare
  equal. (The repo uses ``core.autocrlf=true``: LF in the index, CRLF in the
  working tree.)
* ``block_matches(block_text, canonical, match)`` -- the equality / prefix test.
* ``classify_agents(block_id, agents_dir)`` -- partition the agent files for a
  given block into ``{"standard": [...], "variant": [...], "other": [...]}``.

Design notes
------------
* The ``operating-context`` block is special: 27 agents share a **byte-identical
  leading paragraph** (the canonical text below). 21 of them carry ONLY that
  paragraph; the other 6 (bug-replicator, diagnostic-researcher,
  editability-reviewer, interaction-reviewer, mini-qa, qa-replayer) append
  role-specific text after it. Both kinds are ``standard_agents`` for this block
  because they all begin with the canonical prefix; the matcher for this block
  is therefore PREFIX-based (``match == "prefix"``), and the sync tool rewrites
  only the prefix region while preserving any appended text. The other two
  blocks are matched with full equality (``"equals"``).
* The three VAO agents (adversarial-reviewer, interaction-observer,
  oracle-deriver) carry deliberately role-specific variant forms of the git and
  checkpoint blocks and OMIT the v1.0.0 operating-context heading entirely. They
  are the ``variant_agents`` for all three blocks and are never rewritten.

The ``standard_agents`` / ``variant_agents`` lists below are baked from an
inventory of the tree; ``classify_agents`` re-derives the partition at runtime so
drift surfaces in the sync tool and the drift-guard tests rather than going
unnoticed.

FORBIDDEN_GIT_OPERATIONS = "## Forbidden git operations\n\nYou MUST NOT run destructive git operations: `git stash` / `git stash pop`, `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`, `git checkout <other-branch>` / `git checkout .`, `git clean -f`. These manipulate shared state across teammates within the same run and have caused real-world clobbering — the v1.6.0 worked example in `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Teammate git discipline` documents four teammates running concurrent `git stash` against one working tree, the reflog showing 10+ consecutive `reset: moving to HEAD` entries, and three of four teammates' work lost. For baseline verification, use the orchestrator-provided `$BASELINE_SHA` (carried in your spawn brief's `baseline_sha` field per `team-spawning-and-review-gates` `## Baseline SHA capture`) with `git diff $BASELINE_SHA -- <your-files>` instead of stashing."

CHECKPOINT_DISCIPLINE = '## Checkpoint discipline\n\nWhen your work is expected to exceed ~20 tool calls, write a checkpoint to `.architect-team/agent-checkpoints/<your-agent-id>.json` every ~10 calls (or after each logical step) per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Agent checkpoint discipline`. On resume after a stream timeout, read your own checkpoint FIRST and skip already-completed steps. The checkpoint schema: `{agent_id, task_id, last_completed_step, files_touched, in_progress, ts}`. If you have no `Write` tool (an analysis-only agent), you cannot persist a checkpoint file — instead, return your checkpoint state (the same fields) in your final report so a resumed dispatch can recover.'

OPERATING_CONTEXT = '## Operating context (v1.0.0)\n\nPer `skills/team-spawning-and-review-gates/SKILL.md` `## Operating context (v1.0.0) — for teammate agents`, you are a long-lived teammate in an architect-team run — not a one-shot subagent; you stay in your role across multiple tasks within this run, you receive tasks from the Lead and write a solution requirement for any follow-up that needs a different agent type, and you do NOT spawn other agents or teams yourself.'

# The compact operating-principles block. This is the SINGLE CANONICAL SOURCE for
# CT6's load-bearing principles as they are injected into every agent AND into the
# five pipeline-driving skills: the agent sync tool inserts/refreshes it as a
# `## Operating principles` section, and scripts/setup/compile_skills.py imports
# this exact string to fill the `ct6:block:principles` fences in the skills. The
# full statements (each with its named anti-pattern) live in `docs/ETHOS.md`; this
# block is the compact, always-loaded reminder that points there.

    "each with its named anti-pattern — live in `docs/ETHOS.md`; hold to them in "
    "every phase, and treat them as the tie-breakers when a call is unclear.\n\n"
    "- **Reuse before build.** Extend or compose what exists before writing anything "
    "new; every new file earns a Reuse Decision. Anti-pattern: the greenfield reflex.\n"
    "- **The producer is never its own checker.** Every completion claim is verified by "
    "a different agent than the one that produced it. Anti-pattern: self-attestation.\n"
    "- **Honest boundary.** Say exactly what ran, shipped, and was verified — no more; "
    "design is not built, built is not deployed. Anti-pattern: the overclaim.\n"
    "- **Unbounded solving.** Loop until the gate is green; never hand back a "
    "half-finished run on an iteration count. Anti-pattern: the arbitrary stop.\n"
    "- **Default to action.** Gates are opt-in; on reversible work, pick the sensible "
    "default and proceed. Anti-pattern: permission-seeking.\n"
    "- **Documentation currency.** Docs ship current or the run does not ship. "
    "Anti-pattern: the stale grid.\n"
    "- **Evidence before assertion.** State a result only after running the check and "
    "reading its output. Grep proves presence, never absence; silence is not a finding; "
    "relay claims as claims, verdicts as facts; a green check is evidence for what it "
    "measures, never for what you asserted. Anti-pattern: the unverified \"should work\".\n"
    "- **Understand before acting.** Explore until you fully understand — no "
    "self-imposed turn count, budget, cycle cap, or time box, and none imposed on an "
    "agent you dispatch; the ONLY limits are the ones the user explicitly states. "
    "Anti-pattern: the self-rationed investigation.\n\n"
