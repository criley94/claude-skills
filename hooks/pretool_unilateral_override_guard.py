Fires BEFORE Edit / Write / NotebookEdit tool calls when:

  1. An active pipeline run is in flight (workspace's `.architect-team/

  2. The about-to-fire tool targets a source file (NOT under

  3. No `Skill(architect-team-pipeline)` (or sibling pipeline skill)

When all three conditions hold, exit 2 to block the tool call. The stderr
message names the violation + the disclosure-required alternative.

# v3.56.0 (ADV-3 / ADV-5, adversarial review) — the completion lock's GROUND

#
#   ADV-3  one Write flips every ask-ledger entry to "resolved"
#   ADV-5  writing "status": "completed" straight into a harness task JSON
#          bypasses review-gate-task.py entirely, because that hook is
#          PostToolUse(TaskUpdate) and only ever sees the TOOL, never a
#          filesystem write
#
# Closing a task through `TaskUpdate` stays entirely legitimate — that is the
# harness's own surface and the gate reads its result. What is forbidden is
# reaching around it and editing the record directly.
#
# HONEST BOUNDARY: this raises the cost and makes the bypass a deliberate,
# visible act rather than an accident. An agent with unrestricted Bash can
# still write these files by other means; no hook-tier guard can prevent that.

# `.claude/settings.local.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json` — Write and Edit
# both exit 0.
#
# That matters because the `env` block reaches spawned processes, which is not a
