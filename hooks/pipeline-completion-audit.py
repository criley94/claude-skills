"""Stop hook for the architect-team plugin — pipeline completion audit.

The architect-team orchestrator runs as the main agent session. No hook can
gate its mid-run behaviour, but a `Stop` hook CAN gate its TERMINAL state:
this hook blocks the orchestrator from ending a turn while a pipeline run is
demonstrably incomplete — open solution requirements, test-failure SRs with no
diagnostic plan, an unsatisfied editability loop, or an unresolved
test-completeness debt. These checks are the WORKLIST the dev-loop keeps
closing until empty (success); they are NOT an iteration/give-up gate. There is
no iteration ceiling — the run loops until every requirement is green (see the
Unbounded solving discipline in skills/common-pipeline-conventions).

The `Stop` trigger is UNCHANGED across the v1.0.0 agent-teams refactor — both
subagents mode (the v0.9.x dispatch shape) and teams mode (the v1.0.0
agent-teams shape) fire the same `Stop` event on the main Lead / orchestrator
session at end-of-turn. Per REQ-4.4 of `agent-teams-mode/spec.md`, this hook's
body runs verbatim in both modes; no mode-branch is needed. (Its sibling hooks
`review-gate-task.py` and `teammate-idle-check.py` DO branch on payload shape,
since their triggers split into `PostToolUse(TaskUpdate)` vs `TaskCompleted` and
`SubagentStop` vs `TeammateIdle` respectively.)

It is also runnable standalone as a pre-commit gate:
    python3 pipeline-completion-audit.py --check
Phase 8 runs this BEFORE auto-commit; only a clean (exit 0) result may commit.
(--check audits the WORKLIST only — the run-lifecycle guard below deliberately
does not apply, since Phase 8 runs the check while the run is still active.)

v3.30.0 — the CONTINUATION GUARD. Two upgrades close the "we've done a lot,
want me to continue?" arbitrary-stop gap:

1. RUN LIFECYCLE: while `.architect-team/active-run.json` says a run is
   ACTIVE (see hooks/run_continuity.py), a Stop is blocked even when the
   worklist audit is momentarily clean — a run between phases is not done.
   Done means the orchestrator ran `run_continuity.py --mark-complete` as the
   final phase action (after auto-merge/push). The sanctioned pauses are
   UNCHANGED and checked first: `escalation-pending.md` (human decision) and a
   fresh `in-progress.md` (background work).

2. BOUNDED PERSISTENCE for ENGAGED sessions: for a session whose transcript
   shows it operates under a pipeline skill, `stop_hook_active` no longer
   means give-up-after-one-block. The guard keeps blocking while the run makes
   PROGRESS (the run_continuity fingerprint changes between stops — unbounded,
   per the Unbounded solving discipline), and auto-escalates (writes
   `escalation-pending.md` + allows) after `CT6_MAX_NO_PROGRESS_STOPS`
   (default 3) consecutive NO-progress continuation attempts — so a wedged
   session never infinite-loops. A fresh genuine user prompt resets the budget.

   NON-engaged sessions keep the legacy semantics exactly (block once, then
   `stop_hook_active` => allow), with the block message additionally naming
   the resume-via-Skill directive when a run is active — the one nudge that
   funnels a resumed session back into the pipeline without nagging unrelated
   sessions.

v3.47.0 — three WORKLIST arms join the family, each keyed on state the evidence
files themselves cannot carry (see the per-function docstrings):

- `_audit_check_integrity` — the run's diff adds test files => a passing
  `verify-check-can-fail` verdict must exist (a new guard never shown red is not
  yet evidence).
- `_audit_declared_gates` — every entry in `.architect-team/declared-gates.json`
  must carry `satisfied_at` + an evidence file with bytes in it (a gate you name
  is a gate you keep).
- `_audit_spec_currency` — no teammate with unfinished expected work may still
  be carrying a superseded `spec_fingerprint` with no re-brief record.

All three fail open on a missing trigger (no baseline SHA / no git answer / no
added tests; no registry; no change dir or no stamped manifest), so they are
silent on every workspace that predates them.

v3.56.0 — the COMPLETION LOCK, and it is unlike every arm above it. The arms
above are WORKLIST checks scoped to a CT6 run (`_is_real_run` gates `audit()`).
The lock is not: it fires in EVERY session, including a plain Agent Teams
session that never invoked a CT6 pipeline, and it refuses the stop while
registered work is open — open items in the harness's own per-session task list
(`~/.claude/tasks/session-<first-8>/`), unresolved directives in the accumulated
ask-ledger, or a source it was asked to read and could not. Its exit condition
is read from files the HARNESS writes, so unlike an instruction or a self-typed
promise string there is no wording that clears it.

Its placement in `main()` is load-bearing and documented at the call site: above
EVERY return below it — the escalation-marker return, the fresh-`in-progress.md`
return, the non-engaged early return, and the no-progress budget. Its release
valves are the four operator kill-switches named in `hooks/open_work.py`
(master / task-list / ask-ledger / turn-output), never anything the agent can
write: ON THIS GATE THE QUESTION IS NEVER WHAT A FILE MEANS, IT IS WHO WRITES
IT. Failure semantics are SPLIT — a crash in the lock's own code fails open, an
unreadable SOURCE blocks and is named. And because the lock returns above the
continuation guard, it COMPOSES the guard's block (CONTINUE directive, worklist,
post-compact reload directive) and performs the guard's marker heartbeat, so
neither is lost on an engaged run. See `_completion_lock_action` below.

SAFETY (this hook can block a session, so it is deliberately conservative):
- The WORKLIST arms act ONLY when `.architect-team/` holds a real run (state
  files present) OR an explicit active-run marker exists. The v3.56.0 completion
  lock is the deliberate exception and is scoped by its own four kill-switches
  instead — a session with no open harness task and no unresolved ledger entry
  never sees it. The two agent-written markers below release the worklist arms
  but NOT the lock.
- A `.architect-team/escalation-pending.md` marker => the orchestrator is
  legitimately paused for the human => exit 0 (allow).
- `stop_hook_active: true` + a NON-engaged session => exit 0 (legacy: never
  loop); engaged sessions get the bounded no-progress budget above instead.
- `CT6_RUN_CONTINUITY_DISABLED=1` => full legacy behaviour.
- ANY unexpected error => exit 0 (fail open — never wedge a session on a bug).

Exit codes: 0 = allow / not-an-architect-team-run / clean. 2 = block.

    Aggregates ``files_changed`` across ``.architect-team/reviews/*.json`` and
    runs the v3.44.0 ``frontend_impact.changed_files_touch_frontend`` detector.
    Each review file is a SLICE; a slice is a "frontend slice" when its own
    changed files touch a real frontend UI file. For every frontend slice the
    arm REQUIRES a genuine passing E2E verdict at
    ``.architect-team/frontend-e2e/<slice>-verdict.json``: ``verdict == "passed"``
    AND DEEP genuineness. A missing, non-passing, or non-genuine verdict — OR a
    slice that touched a real frontend UI file but produced only a review-gate
    note — is a BLOCKING violation. The per-task ``frontend_impact_e2e_review``
    note cannot escape this run-level check: the arm requires the EXECUTED,
    genuine artifact, never the note.

    DEEP genuineness (v3.55.0 adversarial B1 fix): the per-slice check is NOT a
    shallow ``len(...) >= 1`` count — it REUSES the 22nd Layer-3 tool
    ``verify_frontend_e2e_loop_exit``, so a populated-but-fake verdict (api-only
    ``page.request`` actions, vacuous title/navigate assertions, a
    claimed-but-absent trace, or a not-executed-against-a-live-env flow) is
    BLOCKED by the arm and named by its escape severity. The verdict/pass axis is
    the arm's own (the tool checks whether the flow was REAL, not whether it
    passed). If the tool cannot be imported the arm degrades to the shallow
    structural checks rather than fail-open-to-nothing.

    Fail-open in three directions: the frontend detector unavailable, the
    kill-switch ``CT6_FRONTEND_E2E_GATE_DISABLED`` set, or no frontend slice in
    the run. An arm that cannot establish its trigger does not block. The
    ``audit()`` ``_is_real_run`` gate keeps it inert outside an actual run.

    Known safe-direction over-block (advisory A1): a type-only ``.ts`` under a
    frontend dir is flagged frontend by the reused v3.44.0 detector, so this arm
    asks it for an E2E verdict too. That is the conservative direction — it never
    under-blocks a real UI change; a genuinely-no-UI slice carries a
    trivially-satisfiable burden, and the per-task ``frontend_impact_e2e_review``
    ``n/a`` + note documents the no-runnable-UI-surface case at the review gate."""

# `changelog_check.py --require-measurements` was the ONLY place the
# measurement existence arm bites, and NOTHING invoked it — the release's own
# backing check was checklist-strength, a human remembering to type a command.
# A script nobody runs is the same as a note nobody reads, one level up from
# the defect the v3.60.0 measurement engine fixed.
#
# The firing condition is deliberately NARROW, because both failure modes were
# measured on the release that shipped the engine:
#   * only a run that BUMPED `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is gated — the
#     currency comparison is meaningless against mid-cycle trees, and a
#     non-release run blocked on the PREVIOUS release's now-stale artifact
#     would be the unsatisfiable-gate shape;
#   * only once the CHANGELOG top entry NAMES the manifest version — the
#     authoring window (bump first, entry last) must never be red by
#     construction, which is the same lesson that moved the existence arm out
#     of the test suite;
#   * only in a workspace that CARRIES the convention (the checker script
#     exists) — every other repo is untouched.

    v3.56.0 split this out of `_emit_continuation_block` so the completion lock
    can COMPOSE it rather than duplicate it. The lock is evaluated above the
    guard and returns, so without this the guard's CONTINUE directive, worklist
    and reload directive would simply vanish on an engaged run with open work.

    `budget_note=None` omits the no-progress footer: the lock deliberately does
    not consume the budget, so reporting a count it never incremented would be
    a false statement about state.

    v3.61.2 — rewritten as an AGENT DIRECTIVE after a field report: a session
    with a lingering marker re-printed this text at the USER on every
    conversational turn, forever (the lock composes it with no budget), and
    the agent never acted on it. Three message defects induced that:

      1. nothing forbade relaying the text to the user, and the safe-looking
         conversational move is to show it;
      2. the mark-complete command carried no ``--root``, so it silently
         depended on the shell's cwd — one failed attempt teaches the agent
         the command "does not work", after which it recites;
      3. the menu led with the escalation option's "user must decide"
         phrasing, priming deferral, while the common stuck case (run
         finished, marker never closed) sat last.

    Now: a no-relay rule up front, a CHECK-then-ACT decision procedure with
    the finished case FIRST and a fully-qualified command (absolute script
    path + ``--root``), the human fork last and explicitly named the only
    user-facing case — and a TERSE form once ``repeat_count >= 2``, because
    the second identical wall of text adds nothing the first did not.
    ``repeat_count`` comes from counters that already exist and are already
    fingerprint-excluded (the guard's no-progress count; the lock's N5b
    notify state) — no new state, per the F5 lesson.

    ``root=None`` degrades to the old cwd-dependent command rather than
    failing; a source pin (test_both_call_sites_pass_root_and_repeat_count)
    asserts every real call site passes both keywords, so the default is a
    safety net, never the path taken.

    "Unbounded" was chosen deliberately: nothing releases a wedged run
    automatically, and that stays true here. But the same sentence was doing a
    second job by accident - nothing TELLS you either - so a run wedged
    overnight with nobody watching produced no signal at all. This emits one
    notification once the lock has blocked persistently and KEEPS BLOCKING. The
    notification reports the state; it never changes it.

    Three constraints, each preventing a named failure:

    1. It does NOT advance the continuation guard's no-progress counter. That
       was the obvious implementation and it is wrong: `escalation-pending.md`
       is agent-written and the lock deliberately does not honour it (ADV-1), so
       that route would raise the marker WITHOUT releasing anything, and the
       burned counter would then mis-fire the guard the moment work finally
       closed. This function touches neither.
    2. It cannot gate. Every failure mode - no notifier, no config, a raise, a
       hang - is swallowed, and the caller ignores the return. A block that a
       mail failure could break is worse than no notification.
    3. It fires once per wedge episode, not once per Stop. A gate that emails on
       every Stop trains the reader to filter it, which is the same outcome as
       silence. The counter resets the moment the lock stops blocking, so a
       later wedge notifies again.

    The notifier itself is already opt-in (silent no-op with no
    `.architect-team-notify.json`) and best-effort (always exits 0), so on a
    project that never configured it this whole path is a few file operations.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE MEASURED GAP. v3.56.0 refuses a stop while registered work is open, and it
# reads that from the harness task store. A CT6 run puts NOTHING there: the
# pipeline instructs task creation in five places and every one of them is for
# TEAMMATE DISPATCH ("the Lead creates 3 reviewer tasks"). Measured on the
# session that shipped four releases, `session-dd12b61c` held ZERO task files —
# the gate was armed and its only source was empty, so four turns ended on green
# with the lock inert.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT AN INSTRUCTION. "Instruct the orchestrator to TaskCreate" is
# precisely what already failed: the harness's own standing reminder to use the
# task tools was rendered on every one of those turns and ignored on every one.
# A stopping condition the agent can decline is not a stopping condition. So the
# ABSENCE of registration is itself made an open-work condition — a run that has
# not said what it is doing cannot end its turn.
#
# WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN `audit()`. Every `_audit_*` arm is released by
# the no-progress budget, by `escalation-pending.md`, and by a fresh
# `in-progress.md` — all three of which the AGENT writes. An arm placed there
# would be waved off by one file write, which is the self-asserted exit this
# whole gate exists to remove. It rides the completion lock instead, above all
# of them.

    An escape costs enforcement; a wedge costs the user's trust in the whole
    mechanism, which is how a gate gets switched off for real.

    THREE recognisers, because the first two were not enough (F9). ALL THREE
    are the substrate's — this function only asks:

    1. a parseable ``CT6-TEAMMATE`` name;
    2. the bare token — the substrate's own standdown (REQ-4);
    3. a FIRST INBOUND that is a peer envelope, added to `open_work` by F9's
       second half so the arm and the lock proper cannot disagree about who is
       a worker. They did disagree, briefly, and the wedge survived in the half
       this file does not govern.

    (3) is what closes the measured wedge. A real CT6 teammate brief does NOT
    carry the token — it arrives as a `<teammate-message>` envelope — so on the
    brief shape this project actually dispatches, `teammate_name` resolved None,
    no token was present, and the arm held the worker at exit 2.

    WHY NOT "stand down unless the session is the marker's recorded
    orchestrator", which is the same ownership question F7 answers: in TEAMS
    MODE — CT6's default — the Lead and every teammate run under ONE session id
    and the marker records it, so `is_orchestrator_session` is True for all of
    them. Measured. It is the identical fact `review-gate-task.py` records as
    the reason its condition (c) exists, and it means the session test cannot
    separate a worker from its Lead at all. `_marker_names_another_session`
