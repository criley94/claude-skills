"""Run-continuity substrate — v3.30.0.

Single source of truth for the ACTIVE-RUN lifecycle marker and the progress
fingerprint that together make architect-team runs (1) autonomous — the Stop
hook keeps an engaged orchestrator session working until the run is genuinely
complete instead of letting it end its turn with "we've done a lot, want me to
continue?" — and (2) sticky across resume/compact — once a pipeline run is
active in a workspace, hand-solving outside the pipeline is blocked until the
run completes or the USER explicitly stands the pipeline down.

The marker: ``<workspace>/.architect-team/active-run.json``
    {
      "schema": 1,
      "status": "active" | "complete" | "stood-down",
      "skill": "architect-team-pipeline",         # the run-driving skill
      "session_id": "...",                        # session that engaged it
      "started_at": "<ISO 8601>",
      "updated_at": "<ISO 8601>",
      "run_id": null | "...",                     # orchestrator fills via --set
      "slug": null | "...",
      "phase": null | "...",
      "completed_at": null | "<ISO 8601>",
      "stand_down_reason": null | "..."
    }

Who writes it:
  - ``hooks/pretool_skill_gate.py`` ENGAGES it deterministically the moment a
    run-driving Skill is invoked (PreToolUse fires on the Skill tool; no LLM
    cooperation required).
  - The orchestrator keeps ``phase`` / ``slug`` / ``run_id`` current via
    ``--set`` at phase boundaries (observability, not enforcement).
  - The orchestrator marks the run complete via ``--mark-complete`` as the
    final Phase 8 / B8 / M8 / U9 action (after the auto-merge / push).
  - The USER's explicit direction to work outside the pipeline is recorded via
    ``--stand-down "<the user's words>"`` — an auditable artifact
    (``pipeline-stand-down.md``), mirroring ``escalation-pending.md``.

Who reads it:
  - ``hooks/pretool_skill_gate.py`` (sticky arm) — blocks build/dispatch tools
    in a user-facing session that has NOT engaged a pipeline skill since the
    last compact boundary while a run is active.
  - ``hooks/pipeline-completion-audit.py`` (continuation guard) — blocks an
    engaged orchestrator session's Stop while the run is active-incomplete,
    bounded by the no-progress counter below.
  - ``hooks/sessionstart-run-continuity.py`` — injects the resume directive at
    session startup / resume / clear / compact.

The progress fingerprint: a stable hash over the run's observable state
(``.architect-team/**`` stat data, git HEAD, and ``git status --porcelain``).
The Stop-hook continuation guard uses it to distinguish "still making
progress -> keep going, unbounded" from "wedged -> auto-escalate after
``CT6_MAX_NO_PROGRESS_STOPS`` consecutive no-progress continuation attempts"
— preserving the Unbounded solving discipline (no iteration ceiling) while
never infinite-looping a genuinely stuck session.

Kill-switch: ``CT6_RUN_CONTINUITY_DISABLED=1`` disables every run-continuity
enforcement surface (sticky arm, continuation guard, SessionStart directive)
without touching the legacy worklist audit.

Fail-open by construction: every reader returns ``None`` / ``False`` /
``""`` on missing or malformed state; writers swallow ``OSError``. Stdlib-only.
