"""PreToolUse hard-gate — real-time skill-invocation enforcement.

Upgrades the Layer-6 skill-invocation audit (``hooks/skill_invocation_audit.py``)
from after-the-fact DETECTION (a Stop-hook auditor that flags a missed ``Skill``
invocation only AFTER the turn ends) to real-time PREVENTION.

The gap this closes: when a user invokes a plugin command that mandates a skill
(e.g. ``/architect-team:architect-team`` — the command body *instructs* the model
to invoke a ``Skill``, but nothing FORCES it), the model can "drive the pipeline
by hand" and never call the ``Skill`` tool. Soft prompts (the user's CLAUDE.md
directive, the command body, the using-superpowers skill) are routinely
rationalized past. Deterministic code cannot be.

Behaviour: when the session transcript's MOST RECENT genuine user prompt is an
unsatisfied pipeline-command request (no matching ``Skill`` tool call appears
AFTER it), this hook BLOCKS (exit 2) the first BUILD / DISPATCH tool call —
``Edit`` / ``Write`` / ``NotebookEdit`` / ``Agent`` / ``Task`` (the tools that
actually do the pipeline's work) — and tells the model to invoke the required
Skill first. It deliberately does NOT block read-only investigation
(``Read`` / ``Grep`` / ``Glob`` / ``ToolSearch`` / ...) or the slash-command
WRAPPER's own documented pre-Skill setup (the dispatch banner, worktree
cleanup/creation — all ``Bash``). A well-behaved run invokes the Skill before any
build/dispatch tool, so the gate never fires on it; it fires ONLY on a genuine
attempt to build or dispatch by hand before loading the pipeline. The instant a
matching ``Skill`` call appears in the transcript, the gate opens.

Detection is REUSED from ``hooks/skill_invocation_audit.py`` (``find_skill_requests``
+ ``COMMAND_TO_SKILLS``); this hook adds the PreToolUse plumbing and reads the
live session transcript (whose path the harness passes in the payload) for both
the user requests and the assistant's prior ``Skill`` ``tool_use`` blocks.

UNIVERSAL / GLOBAL to the plugin: it keys off the plugin's own discovered command
set and the ``Skill``-tool ledger ONLY. It contains NO reference to any specific
codebase, repo, app, or project, and works in any repository the plugin is
installed into.

v3.30.0 adds a SECOND arm — the STICKY RUN arm (run-continuity). The v3.15.0
arm anchors to the most-recent user prompt, so a resumed session whose latest
prompt is "continue" (not a pipeline command) stood the gate down and the model
could hand-solve mid-run. Now, while ``.architect-team/active-run.json`` says a
pipeline run is ACTIVE (the marker this hook itself engages the moment a
run-driving Skill is invoked — see ``hooks/run_continuity.py``), a user-facing
session that has NOT invoked a pipeline skill since its last compact boundary
is blocked from build/dispatch tools until it re-invokes the Skill. Once the
architect team is engaged for a run, the run is driven through the pipeline
until it completes or the USER explicitly stands it down — never abandoned to
hand-solving because a resume prompt didn't repeat the command.

SAFETY (this hook can block a tool call, so it is deliberately conservative):
- The ``Skill`` tool itself is ALWAYS allowed (else the model could never
  satisfy the mandate).
- Only BUILD/DISPATCH tools gate (``Edit`` / ``Write`` / ``NotebookEdit`` /
  ``Agent`` / ``Task`` ...); read-only investigation (``Read`` / ``Grep`` / ...)
  and the command wrapper's ``Bash`` setup are NEVER blocked (the v3.15.1 fix
  for over-firing on the wrapper's documented pre-Skill steps).
- Scoped to pipeline-DRIVING commands only (expected skill is a pipeline skill);
  read-only commands (``/status`` ...) and built-in REPL commands (``/effort``,
  ``/model``) never gate.
- Arm 1 stays anchored to the SINGLE most-recent genuine user prompt; the
  sticky arm activates ONLY on an explicit ``active-run.json`` marker with
  ``status: "active"`` and an explicit ``cwd`` in the payload.
- BOTH arms stand down for a WORKER session — a pipeline teammate (the
  ``CT6-TEAMMATE`` spawn-brief token, or the brief-shaped-first-prompt
  fallback) or a sidechain/subagent transcript (no genuine user prompt).
  Blocking the pipeline's own workers would brick the run; a subagent cannot
  invoke the user-facing Skill anyway. The worker-session detection is shared
  with the sticky arm (``run_continuity.is_teammate_transcript`` /
  ``session_has_genuine_prompt``) so the two arms cannot diverge
  (SR-gate-teammate-false-block, M1 — arm 1 previously lacked this standdown).
- The genuine-user-prompt anchor EXCLUDES the harness's injected ``role: user``
  records: ``isMeta`` body-echoes, ``promptSource == "system"`` notifications,
  ``isSidechain`` subagent records, AND ``<teammate-message ...>`` envelopes —
  the SendMessage-injected PEER messages. Without the last exclusion an inbound
  peer message re-anchors the arm-1 search PAST a satisfying Skill call and
  re-arms the gate mid-run (SR-gate-teammate-false-block, M2).
- The sticky arm additionally stands down for: sessions already operating under
  a pipeline skill (engaged since the last compact boundary), a ``complete`` /
  ``stood-down`` marker, and the ``CT6_RUN_CONTINUITY_DISABLED=1`` kill-switch.
- The USER's explicit direction to work outside the pipeline is honoured via
  ``python hooks/run_continuity.py --stand-down "<their words>"`` — an
  auditable artifact, not a silent bypass.
- No transcript path / unreadable transcript / no pending request => allow.
- ANY unexpected error => allow (fail open — never wedge a session on a bug).

Exit codes: 0 = allow. 2 = block (a pending skill-invocation mandate, or an
active run awaiting resume-via-Skill).

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# A run commits as the PERSON driving it, and the tool never decides who that
# is. The front-door commands resolve the checkout's identity once (asking the
# user when nothing is recorded — a domain gate) into
# `<main-worktree>/.architect-team/git-identity.json`; every commit-authoring
# git command (`commit` / `merge` / `revert`) must then carry it explicitly —
# the `git_identity.py git --` wrapper or `-c user.name= -c user.email=`. This
# arm refuses, during an ACTIVE run, a commit-authoring Bash command that has
# no record to carry, carries none, or carries a DIFFERENT identity. A
# hardcoded maintainer override shipped in a skill body for 60+ releases and
# committed as one person on everyone's machine; this arm is what makes the
# rule structural instead of remembered.
#
# Same deliberate shape as arm 3 (each pinned in tests/test_git_identity.py):
#   * payload-only (tool_name + tool_input.command + cwd + marker) — NO
#     transcript dependence;
#   * scoped to an ACTIVE, non-stale run marker — a plain session's own git
#     usage is never hijacked;
#   * `escalation-pending.md` does NOT stand it down (agent-writable);
#   * its OWN kill-switch only — the HUMAN's lever.
