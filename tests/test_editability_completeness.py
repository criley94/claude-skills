"""v0.9.7 — editability-completeness discipline structural tests.

Reported gap: the design gets wired up, but not every attribute the frontend
exposes is actually editable end-to-end. An entity has a `title`, but there is
no field to set it when creating the thing — and no existing gate catches it
(playwright tests buttons that work; visual-fidelity tests how it looks).

v0.9.7 adds the `editability-completeness` skill: three editability-reviewer
agents (Opus) independently enumerate every attribute, classify which a user
should control, trace each end-to-end (UI -> state -> API -> request schema ->
handler -> database -> read-back), argue to a converged list, route gaps as
solution requirements, and re-review until satisfied.

These tests assert the discipline is present across the skill + agent +
command + wire-up so it cannot silently regress.
