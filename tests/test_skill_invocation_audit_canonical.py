"""A10 (review-remediation): hooks/skill_invocation_audit.py CANONICAL_COMMANDS
equals the live commands/*.md basenames, and the two worst matcher defects are
fixed WITHOUT broadening behavior.

  - CANONICAL_COMMANDS == {p.stem for p in commands/*.md} — the constant is
    derived from the directory so it can never drift; no phantom
    mempalace-search / mempalace-status / code-review entries remain.
  - (a) The slash matcher does NOT fire on a `/status`-like substring inside a
    URL / file path; generic single-token words (`status` / `mini`) require the
    `/architect-team:`-prefixed form.
  - (b) The prose matcher fires on the space form "use my architect team" (and
    "use the architect-team") — the documented user trigger phrase.

The pre-existing tests/test_vao_skill_invocation_audit.py is updated minimally
where A10 changed its behavior; these NEW assertions pin the A10-specific
contract in a dedicated file.
