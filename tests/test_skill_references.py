"""Reference-extraction contract for the largest skills (REQ-005).

Deep, rarely-fired per-phase procedure detail is extracted from the largest
``skills/*/SKILL.md`` files into per-skill ``references/<id>.md`` blocks, each left
behind as a ``> **STOP.**`` pointer plus a ``## Reference index`` table. Extraction
keeps every heading (so cross-reference anchors still resolve) and — per the
mission's conservatism mandate — keeps every gate / discipline inline; only
behavior-neutral deep procedure detail moves.

Target and recorded before/after byte counts (the mission's "record before/after"):

    common-pipeline-conventions : 259290 -> 258442  (-848)   [Auto-worktree lifecycle]

The recorded counts are LF-normalized (the form the index carries). The repo runs
`core.autocrlf=true`, so a Windows working tree measures one extra byte per line
and this pin reads red there — a known platform artifact of `read_bytes()`, not a
regrowth. v3.47.0 grew the body by the declared-gates + spec-currency disciplines
and the compiled principles clause, then the adversarial-batch corrections (248657 -> 256080) and the
v3.59.0 evidence-integrity clause + v3.59.2 doc sweep (259281 -> 259250; the clause rode the
compiled principles block and the live-environment pointer was trimmed ~109 bytes to absorb it,
every trimmed detail verified present in references/local-dev-test-discipline.md). Before that
the v3.57.0 local->dev->test-on-dev discipline (258442 -> 259281; its bulk went straight to
references/local-dev-test-discipline.md, so the SKILL body took only the pointer and the
file still sits under the 259290 pre-extraction baseline). Before that the
v3.48.0 contract-first-parallelism canonical section (256080 -> 258442, a NEW cross-pipeline
discipline which the extraction mission's own 'keep every gate/discipline inline' rule requires to
stay in the body; its full protocol lives in skills/contract-first-parallelism/), still under
the baseline.

HONEST DIVERGENCE — the other two of the three largest skills (architect-team-pipeline
133226 B, bug-fix-pipeline 89329 B) are NOT targets. They are the pipeline
orchestrators, and exhaustive per-block analysis (verified against the full discipline
test-suite) found every substantial block in each to be one of: a gate (Phase 8's
deploy-mandate / unilateral-override / doc-currency gates; bug-fix Phase B4 / B6 / B8
gates), a discipline (Structured bug-isolation; run-state; operating rules), or wiring
whose tokens the suite grep-pins anywhere in the body (notifications, agent-resume,
Layer-3 tool invocations, INTERACTION_INTUITION_MAP binding-input). The mission's
"keep every gate/discipline inline" rule requires all of those to stay in the body.
The only behavior-neutral candidate blocks that remain — architect-team-pipeline's
Phase 4 (897 B) and bug-fix-pipeline's "Relationship to other skills" (1262 B) — are
each smaller than the mandated principles block this run injects (1381 B), so no
conservative extraction can net-reduce either without either breaking the suite or
moving a discipline out of the skill body. Both are forbidden, so this test asserts
the one skill (common-pipeline-conventions) that carries a genuinely
behavior-neutral, rarely-fired, test-safe heavy block.

    #     STOP pointer only, its full rules extracted to
    #     references/augment-never-replace.md — the section could not be carried
    #     inline at any length, since 259287 against the cap left 2 bytes.
    #     PAID FOR by compressing `## Local -> dev -> test-on-dev ...` (v3.57.0)

    #     inline paragraph DUPLICATED references/local-dev-test-discipline.md,

    #     cites the section by heading was disturbed. Making room by extraction
    #     is this regime's own mechanism; raising the cap would have defeated it.

    #     took the file to 263699 — 4409 OVER the cap. PAID FOR by extracting
    #     the v2.5.0 narrative of `## In-flight clarification discipline`
    #     (failure shape, detection-signal table, fold procedure, anti-pattern
    #     rationales, cancellation table, clarifications-log schema — ~9.7 KB,
    #     orchestrator-only relevance that every agent was carrying) to
    #     references/in-flight-clarification-discipline.md behind a STOP
    #     pointer + a one-paragraph inline summary that keeps every phrase the
    #     suite pins; `### Parallel lanes (v3.16.0)` stays INLINE verbatim
    #     because tests/test_parallel_lane_inject.py pins its mechanics there.
    #     Same mechanism as v3.63.0: extraction, not a raised cap.
