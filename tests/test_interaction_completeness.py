"""v0.9.19 — interaction-completeness discipline structural tests.

Reported gap: the architect-team pipeline keeps shipping frontend work that is
not what it claims to be. Playwright "user-flow" tests pass without driving the
UI (they call the API directly, or only navigate-and-assert); routes ship wired
to placeholder / "coming soon" pages instead of the live pages they should be;
and hardcoded sample values ship where a dynamic, data-bound value belongs.
None of the existing gates catches this — a grep finds PRESENT bad patterns,
not an untested button, a placeholder page, or a value hardcoded where it
should be dynamic.

v0.9.19 adds the `interaction-completeness` skill: three `interaction-reviewer`
agents (Opus) independently enumerate every interactive element AND every page,
classify each element by how it is wired and each page as live / placeholder /
confirmed-stub, verify every non-stub element has a genuine user-driven
Playwright test, trace each element to its endpoint, argue to a converged
interaction map, route gaps as solution requirements, and re-review until
satisfied — modeled on the proven `editability-completeness` skill.

These tests assert the discipline is present across the skill + agent so it
cannot silently regress. (Registration in EXPECTED_SKILLS / EXPECTED_AGENTS is
asserted by a later teammate per REQ-007 — not here.)
