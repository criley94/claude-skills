"""Wiring pins for the thin hooks that bind the existing lanes to the new
`intuition-map-lifecycle` verbs and the target codebase's suite manifest
(tasks 3.1-3.7 of the `playwright-suite-intuition-lifecycle` change).

Each hook is a short named paragraph at ONE named location in an EXISTING
surface. The pins here assert the text at that location — sliced to the named
phase / step section, so a pin cannot pass because the phrase happens to appear
somewhere else in a 900-line orchestrator (the v3.61.2 lesson: an ordering pin
that matched the WORKLIST's copy of the string passed for the wrong reason).

The pinned migration boundary is the one from design.md D7: absent a suite
manifest, every wired surface behaves exactly as it does today. Each
manifest-registering hook states it in its own section, so a future edit that
drops the boundary reads red here rather than silently making the wiring
mandatory in projects that never ran the suite builder.

Two pins are deliberately NEGATIVE and therefore green from the first run:
`mini-architect-team-pipeline` stays narrow (only the SWEEP gained the full-suite
run, per the suite-pipeline-wiring spec's "mini stays narrow while the sweep runs
the suite" scenario), and the sibling registries in other hook files are NOT
asserted here (they are out of this task's file scope). Both are regression
guards, not red-first behavior pins.

`intuition-map-lifecycle` is referenced by NAME only — this file never reads its
body. `playwright-suite-builder` is referenced by name in the wiring pins, and
its body IS read by exactly one pin, `test_registered_lane_carries_its_lifecycle
_step`, which is deliberate: registering that lane as run-driving is only safe
while its playbook marks the run complete, so the two must be asserted together.
That pin is conditional on the registry, so it goes quiet rather than red if the
lane is ever de-registered.

A note on writing pins in this file, learned repeatedly the hard way here: an
assertion must carry the claim its message makes. Four failure shapes recur.

(a) INTER-hook — a token that already exists in the sliced section, so the pin
    reads red at baseline for a DIFFERENT reason than its message names
    (adversarial F1; witnesses W2/W8/W9/W10). Guard: check the token against the
    fe30a182 baseline slice.

(b) INTRA-hook — a token that IS absent at baseline (so the baseline check above
    calls it discriminating) but comes from the hook's own TITLE or boilerplate
    rather than its instruction text, so renaming the instruction ships green
    (adversarial F6: a bare `grow` matched "**Grow the intuition map...**").
    Guard: check the token against the hook's title as well as the baseline —
    the baseline-only method is structurally blind to this, which is why the
    two checks are named separately here.

(c) RELATIONSHIP — a message describing a link ("the registry entry never
    outlives the lifecycle step") while the assertion tests only one side, so
    the other side can be deleted with the pin still green (first cut of the
    lifecycle pin). Guard: every noun in the message appears in the assertion.

(d) OPEN-ENDED NEGATIVE — a blocklist of forbidden phrasings, which is unbounded
    by construction and escapes on the first unlisted wording (adversarial F3;
    witness W16). Guard: prefer a CLOSED form — count the allowed occurrences —
    over enumerating the disallowed ones.

Related: prose about a step is not the step. Assert the INVOCATION form
(`run_continuity.py" --mark-complete`) rather than a bare substring a comment
could satisfy (adversarial F4; witness W14b).

THE PREVENTER — prefer this to all four guards above. The shapes (a)-(d) are
DETECTORS: each tells you to go check something, and each depends on somebody
remembering to check. Sentence-scoping is structural instead. An assertion that
requires TWO tokens to co-occur in ONE sentence cannot be satisfied by a heading
or a bold title, because a title is one short phrase and carries only one of
them — so shape (b) becomes unreachable rather than merely detectable.

Demonstrated in the sibling lane (skills-author, task-2): a pin asserting
`bug-path` under the heading ``## Verb — `bug-path-upsert` `` is textbook (b)
exposure and a token-level audit condemns it — yet its witness came back RED,
because the real assertion was `_has_sentence_with(section, "source",
"bug-path")` and the heading carries no `source`. The scoping had already closed
the hole the audit was about to flag.

So when a pin needs a token that also appears in a title, do not hunt for a
narrower token: require it to co-occur with a second token the title cannot
carry. Reach for a detector only where co-occurrence genuinely does not apply.
