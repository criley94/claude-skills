"""ETHOS doc + principles-block injection (REQ-001).

Asserts the three legs of the principles-injection contract:

1. ``docs/ETHOS.md`` exists and states >= 5 load-bearing principles, each with a
   named anti-pattern.
2. Every ``agents/*.md`` carries the current canonical principles block (injected
   + kept current by ``scripts/setup/sync_agent_boilerplate.py``).
3. Each of the five pipeline-driving skills carries the current canonical
   principles block inside its ``ct6:block:principles`` fences (kept current by
   ``scripts/setup/compile_skills.py``).

Plus the drift guards: a hand-edit of an agent block or a skill's fenced content
is detected, and the principles text lives in exactly one canonical source.

Module loaders use the shared importlib-by-path helper because ``scripts/setup``
is not an installed package.
