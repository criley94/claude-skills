description: Faster bug-focused variant of /architect-team. Takes EITHER a requirements folder (with a bug report) OR a plain-language bug description typed directly — a sentence describing the symptom, what was expected, what actually happened — and drives it through a replicate → reproduce-test → propose → fix → QA-replay loop against the live dev environment. Replication-first; the artifact that reproduces the bug becomes the regression test; the architect rejects symptom-patches and demands generalized fixes (unless the user explicitly authorized a hotfix); the QA-replayer re-runs the artifacts against the deployed dev fix and only `bug-resolved end-to-end` closes the loop. Auto-commits and pushes on a clean Phase B8 pass and emits a /compact prompt to free context. Accepts the SAME two input forms as /architect-team — folder or plain-language prose, both first-class.

# Bug-Fix Pipeline Orchestration

You are starting the architect-team bug-fix pipeline — a faster, bug-focused variant of `/architect-team`.

**Raw arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

## Dispatch mode banner (v1.5.0) — runs first

As the very first user-visible action of the invocation, BEFORE the v1.3.0
auto-cleanup step and BEFORE argument parsing, print the dispatch-mode banner
so the user knows whether this run is dispatching via Agent Teams or the
subagents fallback (and, in the fallback case, WHY). This is purely
**informational** — the banner is observability, never a gate. A subprocess
failure surfaces a one-line note and the run continues regardless. The
dispatch-mode decision itself is unchanged from v1.0.0 (`is_teams_mode_available`
inspects env + settings.json + `claude --version` + the `--no-teams` flag).

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from teams_mode import format_dispatch_banner; print(format_dispatch_banner())" 2>&1 || python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from teams_mode import format_dispatch_banner; print(format_dispatch_banner())" 2>&1 || echo "(dispatch banner unavailable; continuing.)"
```

The banner is informational, not gating. A subprocess failure surfaces a
one-line note and the run continues regardless. The dispatch-mode decision
itself is unchanged from v1.0.0.

## Commit identity (v3.67.0) — runs after the banner, before any git-mutating step

This run will author commits, and the tool never decides WHO they are attributed to. Resolve the checkout's recorded commit identity now — once per checkout, before the auto-cleanup / branch-reconciliation / auto-worktree steps below can touch git — per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Git commit identity discipline (v3.67.0)` (full procedure: `skills/common-pipeline-conventions/references/git-commit-identity.md`):

```bash
$(command -v python3 || command -v python) "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/git_identity.py" --cwd "<workspace>" resolve --json
```

- `"status": "recorded"` → say *"Committing as `<name> <email>` (recorded for this checkout)"* in one line and continue. No question.
- `"status": "candidate"` → git's local or global config names someone; that is a PROPOSAL, never adopted silently. Ask via `AskUserQuestion`: *"Commit as `<name> <email>`? (found in this repo's local / your global git config)"* — options **Yes, record it for this checkout** / **No — I'll give a different name and email**. Then `$(command -v python3 || command -v python) "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/git_identity.py" --cwd "<workspace>" set --name "<name>" --email "<email>" --source confirmed-local-git-config|confirmed-global-git-config` (or `--source asked` when they typed a different one).
- `"status": "missing"` → ask via `AskUserQuestion` (free text): *"Who should this run's commits be attributed to? Reply `Name <email>`."* Then `set ... --source asked`.

This is a **DOMAIN gate** (the v0.9.21 carve-out — the answer is the user's own fact): it fires regardless of `--proposal-first`, it fires ONCE per checkout (the record is the memory), and it NEVER guesses, NEVER reuses a name found in a skill, a CLAUDE.md or another repo, and NEVER writes the user's git config. Every commit-authoring git command this run issues then carries the record (the `git_identity.py git --` wrapper or the explicit `-c user.name= -c user.email=` pair); the PreToolUse gate refuses one that does not.

## Auto-cleanup of merged worktrees (v1.3.0) — runs first

Before any argument parsing or pipeline invocation, sweep merged architect-team
worktrees. This is **best-effort** — failure surfaces a one-line note and the
new run continues regardless.

1. Refresh the origin ref so merge detection is current. Best-effort:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
2. Invoke the cleanup helper via the polyglot Python pattern per
   `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Cross-platform Python invocation`:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import cleanup_merged_worktrees; [print(f'cleaned: {p}') for p in cleanup_merged_worktrees()]" 2>&1 || python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import cleanup_merged_worktrees; [print(f'cleaned: {p}') for p in cleanup_merged_worktrees()]" 2>&1 || echo 'auto-cleanup: best-effort, continuing.'
   ```
3. Report any cleaned paths to the user as a brief note. If nothing was
   cleaned, say so in one line and proceed.

The cleanup defaults exclude the current worktree (safety: don't auto-remove
the cwd even if its branch is merged). This is the re-entry case from v1.2.0 —
the current run worktree is left alone.

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-worktree lifecycle` `### Auto-cleanup
(v1.3.0)` for the full rule including merged-branch detection mechanism
(`git merge-base --is-ancestor`) and the squash-merge limitation.

## Startup branch reconciliation (v3.7.0) — runs after the v1.3.0 sweep

After the merged-worktree sweep above, enumerate stray `architect-team/*`
branches and offer to reconcile them. Best-effort + a domain gate (one
question); silent no-op when there are none.

1. Enumerate run branches via the polyglot Python pattern:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import sys,json; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import list_run_branches; print(json.dumps([b for b in list_run_branches() if not b['merged_into_main']]))" 2>&1 || python -c "import sys,json; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import list_run_branches; print(json.dumps([b for b in list_run_branches() if not b['merged_into_main']]))" 2>&1 || echo '[]'
   ```
2. If the list is EMPTY → silent no-op; proceed to argument parsing.
3. If non-empty → present ONE `AskUserQuestion` with three options:
   - **merge-all-clean + prune** → for each branch with `cleanly_mergeable:
     true`, call `merge_branch_to_main_and_prune(branch, worktree_path)` via the
     polyglot Python; report any branch returning `conflict: true`.
   - **prune-without-merge** → `cleanup_run_worktree(Path(worktree_path),
     remove_branch=True)` per branch (discard the work).
   - **leave** → no-op.
4. Only `architect-team/*` branches are ever considered — never the user's own
   branches, never this command's OWN run branch.

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-merge-to-main discipline (v3.7.0)`
for the canonical rule.

## Argument parsing (do this first, before invoking the skill)

**Strip the recognised flags from `$ARGUMENTS` first; everything left is the requirement (the bug).**

Flags (each independent — `--no-commit --no-compact` is valid; natural-language phrasings count as the matching flag):

- `--no-commit` → `AUTO_COMMIT = false`, `AUTO_PUSH = false`.
- `--no-push` → `AUTO_COMMIT = true`, `AUTO_PUSH = false`.
- `--no-compact` → `AUTO_COMPACT_PROMPT = false`. (Default `true`.)
- `--allow-push-to-default` → `ALLOW_PUSH_TO_DEFAULT = true`. (Default `false`.) When false, the pipeline does NOT commit + push unreviewed work straight onto `main` / `master` — it commits to an `architect-team/<bug-slug>` feature branch and recommends a PR.
- `--proposal-first` → `PROPOSAL_FIRST = true`. (Default `false`.) Runs Phases B−1 → B3 (intake + replication + reproduction-test + the OpenSpec proposal package), then PAUSES for user review before Phase B4. **Domain gates** — the Phase B1 ambiguity-escalation question, the Phase B4 audit `needs-clarification`, the Phase B5 production-deploy escalation — fire regardless of this flag.
- `--environment production` → `TARGET_ENVIRONMENT = production`. Forces Phase B5 to escalate before deploying (production deploys are user decisions, never automatic).
- `--force-bug` → tells the Phase B0 classifier-warning to skip ("this looks like a feature, run /architect-team instead") and proceed anyway. Use when you know it IS a bug despite ambiguous wording.
- `--no-deploy` → skip Phase B5's auto-deploy step; QA replay (B6) runs against whatever is already deployed. Use when the dev environment is hand-managed.
- `--no-refine` → skip the upstream `proposal-refiner` skill (v0.9.33). Default `false` — when `$REQ_DIR` is plain-language prose AND the input is not already a refined-prompt markdown, the pipeline invokes `proposal-refiner` FIRST to conversationally clarify the bug description with codebase-map grounding (which dashboard? which row's delete button? which user role?) before Phase B−2 / B−1. Pass `--no-refine` when the bug description is already specific. Domain gate per v0.9.21 — the clarifying conversation IS the deliverable.
- `--no-worktree` → `AUTO_WORKTREE = false`. (Default `true`.) Skip the auto-worktree creation step; run the bug-fix pipeline in the current checkout (v1.1.0 behavior). Natural-language equivalents: *"no worktree"* / *"don't create a worktree"* / *"single tree"* / *"in place"* / *"in current tree"*.
- `--no-auto-merge` → `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN = false`. (Default `true`.) When true (the default), a clean Phase B8 run merges its `architect-team/<bug-slug>` branch into `main`, pushes, deletes the branch (local + remote), and removes the worktree — only when it merges cleanly (conflicts skipped + reported, never forced; branch protection always wins). `--no-auto-merge` restores today's feature-branch + recommend-a-PR + persistence-warning behavior. Natural-language equivalents: *"keep the branch"* / *"PR only"* / *"don't merge to main"* / *"no auto-merge"*. See `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-merge-to-main discipline (v3.7.0)`.
- `--appearance <strict|propose|innovate>` → `APPEARANCE_MODE = <mode>`. (Default `strict`.) A bug-fix run is `strict` by nature — the mandate is the named symptom, and restoring the intended behavior/appearance the bug broke is in scope; restyling beyond it is not. Improvement ideas surfaced during the fix are recorded to `.architect-team/appearance-proposals/<run-id>.json`, never implemented; pass `propose` / `innovate` to widen explicitly. Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Appearance-change policy discipline (v3.14.0)`. Natural-language equivalents — propose: *"propose appearance changes"* / *"ask before changing the look"*; innovate: *"innovate on the UI"* / *"free rein on the design"*.
- No flags → `AUTO_COMMIT = true`, `AUTO_PUSH = true`, `AUTO_COMPACT_PROMPT = true`, `ALLOW_PUSH_TO_DEFAULT = false`, `PROPOSAL_FIRST = false`, `TARGET_ENVIRONMENT = dev`, `AUTO_WORKTREE = true`, `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN = true`, `APPEARANCE_MODE = strict` (default — live dev environment; no unsolicited appearance changes).

### The requirement comes in ONE of two forms — BOTH are first-class, fully-supported inputs

| Form | What it is | Bind `$REQ_DIR` to |
|---|---|---|
| **Folder** | a filesystem path that resolves to an existing directory (holding a bug report, screenshots, prior diagnostic notes, or an OpenSpec brief) | the path |
| **Plain-language requirement** | prose — a phrase, sentence, or paragraph describing the bug (the symptom, what the user expected, what actually happened) | the **entire remaining string, verbatim** |

To tell them apart: if what remains after stripping flags is a single token that resolves to an existing directory → **Folder**. Otherwise → **Plain-language requirement**. **When unsure, it is a plain-language requirement** — a bug description in prose is the common case.

The pipeline's **Phase B0 normalizes a plain-language requirement into an OpenSpec change** — that branch exists precisely for this. A requirements folder is NOT required and never has been.

### Forbidden — the following are bugs, not correct behavior

These rules mirror `/architect-team` exactly (the v0.9.17 same-input-forms rules):

- **Treating the first word of a plain-language requirement as a path.** `no`, `the`, `fix`, `delete`, `clicking` are not directories — the *whole string* is the requirement.
- **Refusing to run** — or telling the user the pipeline "needs a folder" / "only drives a requirements folder" / "I won't run against a non-existent folder" — when given prose. The pipeline accepts a plain-language requirement directly; running it is correct.
- **Asking the user for a requirements folder.** The only thing you may ask for is the bug description itself, and ONLY when `$ARGUMENTS` (flags stripped) is genuinely **empty** — then ask: *"What bug should the bug-fix pipeline replicate and resolve?"*

**Binding into the skill:** the harness does NOT propagate `$ARGUMENTS` into skill bodies. Pass the bound `$REQ_DIR` — a folder path OR the verbatim plain-language requirement string — as the input to the `bug-fix-pipeline` skill, and substitute it for every `$REQ_DIR` reference in the skill body. When the requirement is plain-language prose, the codebase the bug applies to is the current working directory (a git repo) unless the prose names another path. Do NOT re-prompt.

## Pre-pipeline refinement (v0.9.33) — runs BEFORE Phase B−1 when input is plain-language prose

After binding `$REQ_DIR` and BEFORE invoking the `bug-fix-pipeline` skill, determine whether refinement applies:

- **Skip refinement** when ANY of these holds:
  - `$REQ_DIR` resolves to an existing directory on disk.
  - `$REQ_DIR` resolves to a markdown file with `refined-by: proposal-refiner` frontmatter.
  - The `--no-refine` flag was passed.
- **Run refinement** otherwise. Set `$REFINER_MODE = "pipeline"` and invoke the `proposal-refiner` skill from this plugin (use the Skill tool with `skill: proposal-refiner`) passing `$REQ_DIR` (the verbatim bug-description prose) as the input. The skill runs phases R1 → R6 — codebase-map loading (especially `INTERACTION_INTUITION_MAP.md` for frontend bugs, where the wired-vs-stub status of every interactive element is already cataloged), multi-axis grading, conversational refinement (unbounded by default; `--max-iterations` is the user's lever — *"the prompt says 'the delete button doesn't work' but ROUTE_MAP has 7 delete buttons across 4 routes; which one?"*), and final markdown output.

After `proposal-refiner` exits in pipeline mode, **rebind `$REQ_DIR` to the absolute path of the refined-prompt markdown file**. The bug-fix-pipeline's Phase B−1 / B0 intake then operates on the refined brief.

The refiner is a DOMAIN gate per v0.9.21 — the user-confirmation step IS the deliverable. The bug-fix-pipeline's existing Phase B1 ambiguity-escalation question (the canonical *"how did you experience the bug?"* prompt) still fires when needed; the refiner reduces — but does not eliminate — those mid-pipeline escalations by clarifying upstream.

## Auto-worktree creation (v1.2.0) — runs after refinement, before skill invocation

After binding `$REQ_DIR` and completing any refinement, AND BEFORE invoking the `bug-fix-pipeline` skill, determine whether the auto-worktree step applies:

- **Skip the step** when ANY of these holds:
  - `--no-worktree` (or a natural-language opt-out — *"no worktree"* / *"don't create a worktree"* / *"single tree"* / *"in place"* / *"in current tree"*) was passed.
  - The current branch already starts with `architect-team/` (re-entry case — `scripts.setup.worktree_lifecycle.current_worktree_is_run()` returns True). No nested worktrees; the existing run worktree IS the workspace.

- **Run the step** otherwise:
  1. Derive a `<slug>` from the refined-prompt slug (if present in the refined-prompt markdown's frontmatter), the bug-slug used downstream by `bug-fix-pipeline`, or a kebab-case derivation of the bug description's first 4-6 meaningful words.
  2. Invoke the helper via Bash — detect-once Python invocation (the v2.16.0 form): the interpreter is selected ONCE via `$(command -v python3 || command -v python)` and the snippet runs exactly once. `create_run_worktree` raises (a non-zero exit) on collision exhaustion, and the old `python3 X || python X` form would silently re-run the whole creation on that meaningful failure; detect-once invokes it exactly once. Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Cross-platform Python invocation`:
     ```bash
     $(command -v python3 || command -v python) -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import create_run_worktree; print(create_run_worktree('<slug>'))"
     ```
     The helper creates the worktree at `<parent-of-repo>/.<repo-name>-worktrees/<slug>/` (the hidden per-project container, v3.6.0) on branch `architect-team/<slug>` (collision handling appends `-2`, `-3`, ... when either path or branch is taken). Capture the printed absolute path as `$WORKTREE_PATH`.
  3. `chdir` into `$WORKTREE_PATH`. Every subsequent step — including the Skill-tool invocation of `bug-fix-pipeline` — runs with `$WORKTREE_PATH` as cwd. v1.1.0's `shared_state_dir()` resolution keeps the lock layer and MemPalace pointed at the MAIN worktree; `run_state_dir()` resolves per-worktree so bug-fix verdict files / reviews / teammates / handoffs live in the run worktree.
  4. Surface a one-line note to the user: *"Auto-worktree: created `<WORKTREE_PATH>` on branch `architect-team/<slug>`. Pass `--no-worktree` next time to skip."*

On creation failure (parent dir not writable, base branch missing, slug exhausted — the helper raises `RuntimeError` with an actionable message), surface the error verbatim and STOP. Do NOT silently fall back to the current checkout. The user re-runs with `--no-worktree` if they want single-tree mode.

At Phase B8 success the pipeline now calls `finalize_run_worktree($WORKTREE_PATH)` (v3.6.0): it removes the worktree + branch if the branch is already merged into `origin/main`, otherwise it leaves the folder and prints the returned `warning` (which names the path + the manual cleanup command). Unmerged work is never auto-deleted.

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-worktree lifecycle` for the full rules including the path/branch convention, collision handling, the end-of-run merge check emitted at Phase B8 success, and the re-entry detection logic.

## Invoke the pipeline

Invoke the `bug-fix-pipeline` skill from this plugin (use the Skill tool with `skill: bug-fix-pipeline`) and follow its pipeline exactly against the requirement above (a folder OR the refined-prompt markdown that the upstream `proposal-refiner` step produced). The skill begins at Phase B−1 (Intake & Mapping) and proceeds through Phase B8 (Commit + Push).

**Pass the `AUTO_COMMIT`, `AUTO_PUSH`, `AUTO_COMPACT_PROMPT`, `ALLOW_PUSH_TO_DEFAULT`, `PROPOSAL_FIRST`, `TARGET_ENVIRONMENT`, `--no-deploy`, and `--force-bug` flag values to the skill.** The skill's Phase B5 reads `TARGET_ENVIRONMENT` to decide deploy behavior; Phase B0 reads `--force-bug` to skip the classifier warning; Phase B5 reads `--no-deploy` to skip the auto-deploy step; Phase B8 reads the rest for commit / push behavior.

## Default git behavior (when `AUTO_COMMIT = true` and `AUTO_PUSH = true`)

At the end of Phase B8, after the final report emits **"Bug `<bug-slug>` has been resolved."** and the archive path:

0. **Run the completion audit FIRST:** `$(command -v python3 || command -v python) "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/pipeline-completion-audit.py" --check` from the repo root. The `$(command -v python3 || command -v python)` substitution detects whichever Python interpreter is on PATH (Unix: `python3`; default Windows python.org: `python`) and invokes the script **exactly once** — the v2.16.0 fix replacing the prior `python3 X || python X` polyglot which double-executed the script when it returned a meaningful non-zero exit code. If the final exit is non-zero, the run is incomplete — do NOT commit. Resolve violations or escalate.
1. `git -C <repo-root> status --porcelain` to enumerate what changed.
2. `git -C <repo-root> add <files-the-pipeline-touched>` — stage ONLY the files the pipeline created or modified (the openspec change folder, the reproduction artifacts, the fix's source-code changes, any updated maps). Do NOT use `git add -A`.
2b. **Default-branch guard:** if the current branch is `main` / `master` and `ALLOW_PUSH_TO_DEFAULT` is false, `git -C <repo-root> checkout -b architect-team/<bug-slug>` before committing.
3. `git -C <repo-root> commit -m "<commit message per the bug-fix-pipeline skill's Phase B8 template>"` — using the repo's local git config.
4. `git -C <repo-root> push -u origin <branch>` — push the branch the commit landed on.
5. Report the commit SHA and push range in the final user-facing report. If the commit landed on `architect-team/<bug-slug>`, the report MUST say so and recommend opening a PR.

If `AUTO_COMMIT = false`: skip steps 2-5; mention in the report that changes were left uncommitted.

If `AUTO_COMMIT = true` but `AUTO_PUSH = false`: do steps 1-3 only; mention in the report that the commit was made locally but not pushed.

### Auto-merge to main (v3.7.0)

After the completion audit passes + the commit lands on `architect-team/<bug-slug>`, and when `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN = true` (the default):

6. Probe clean-mergeability and, if clean, merge + prune via the polyglot Python (run from / chdir to the MAIN checkout first):
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import sys,json; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import merge_branch_to_main_and_prune; print(json.dumps(merge_branch_to_main_and_prune('architect-team/<bug-slug>', '$WORKTREE_PATH', push=<AUTO_PUSH>)))" 2>&1 || python -c "import sys,json; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import merge_branch_to_main_and_prune; print(json.dumps(merge_branch_to_main_and_prune('architect-team/<bug-slug>', '$WORKTREE_PATH', push=<AUTO_PUSH>)))" 2>&1
   ```
   - On `reason: "merged-and-pruned"` → report: merged into `main`, pushed, branch deleted (local + remote), worktree removed.
   - On `conflict: true` → the merge changed nothing; fall back to today's behavior: keep the branch pushed, recommend a PR, emit the v3.6.0 persistence warning.
   - On `reason: "push-rejected"` (branch protection) → STOP, report, leave recoverable. NEVER force.

When `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN = false` (`--no-auto-merge`): skip step 6 entirely; keep today's feature-branch + recommend-a-PR + persistence-warning behavior verbatim.

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-merge-to-main discipline (v3.7.0)`.

## Auto-compact prompt (after the final report)

When `AUTO_COMPACT_PROMPT = true` AND Phase B8 completed cleanly, emit the standard `/compact` prompt block as the very last thing the user sees:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                ║
║  ◆  READY FOR /compact                                         ║
║                                                                ║

║                                                                ║
║      /compact                                                  ║
║                                                                ║
║  (Pass --no-compact next time to suppress this prompt.)        ║
║                                                                ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

If `AUTO_COMPACT_PROMPT = false`: skip the block.

## Safety rules (non-negotiable)

All the same safety rules as `/architect-team`:

- NEVER force-push.
- NEVER skip git hooks (`--no-verify`). Fix the underlying issue and re-commit.
- NEVER amend the previous commit; always create a new commit.
- If `git push` fails, surface the error clearly and stop — never escalate to force-push.
- Pre-existing unstaged or staged changes are the user's in-progress work — do NOT include them in the pipeline's commit; surface them in the final report.
- **NEVER schedule arbitrary wall-clock wakeups (`ScheduleWakeup`), cron jobs (`CronCreate`), or background timer tools from inside the pipeline.** The pipeline is synchronous; subagent dispatches block your turn. Do NOT tell the user "I scheduled a wakeup for N minutes." For external polling (dev server health after deploy), use a tight bounded in-turn `until` loop.

## Production-environment rule (the one exception to live-by-default)

**`TARGET_ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `dev`.** Phase B5 deploys to the dev environment (per the target project's `design.md` `## Dev Environment` section) and Phase B6 tests against the deployed dev fix. This is the default and the path the pipeline is optimized for.

When `--environment production` is set (or the user's prose names production as the target), Phase B5 does NOT auto-deploy. The orchestrator escalates a structured question to the user — "production deploys are your decision; (a) deploy to production now, (b) deploy to staging first, (c) hold for manual review" — and waits for an answer. This is a domain gate; it fires regardless of `--proposal-first`.

## In-flight clarification discipline (v2.5.0)

If you receive a user message AFTER the pipeline has begun executing (Phase −2 / B−1 / M0 onward) AND the message does NOT explicitly cancel the run AND is NOT a fresh `/architect-team:<command>` invocation, treat the message as a **clarification or scope amendment to the IN-FLIGHT run**, NOT as a new standalone task. Append the message verbatim to `<workspace>/.architect-team/clarifications/<run-id>-<ts>.md`, re-evaluate the in-flight phase against the amended brief (re-run Phase 0/1 if scope materially shifted; otherwise fold into the next phase's inputs), and continue the pipeline. Forbidden: solving the clarification with tools directly (bypasses the pipeline), answering conversationally without folding, spawning a sibling `/architect-team` invocation, or silently ignoring. The canonical rules — 3 detection signals + 4 forbidden anti-patterns + cancellation channel — live in `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## In-flight clarification discipline (v2.5.0)`.
