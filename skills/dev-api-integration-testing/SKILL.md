description: Use when authoring or running integration tests against a backend slice, especially during Phase 5 when verifying against a live dev API. Defines payload conventions, side-effect verification (DB / queue / file), dev-data fixture hygiene, idempotency, and the rule that the system under test runs against real dependencies — mock only what's truly external or non-deterministic.

# Dev-API Integration Testing

> **Before choosing WHERE to verify (v3.66.0):** apply the `verification-planning` skill — enumerate local run / dev environment / replay / seeded fixture / production, prove which venue each claim depends on, run the cheapest faithful venue first, and record the `verification_plan`. The local-then-live sequence below is the venue order for the integration gate; it is never a reason to skip a cheaper faithful check of a claim, and never a reason to wait for an environment the run can provide itself.

Backend tests that pass against mocks and fail against the live system are the most expensive bugs to discover. This skill enforces the discipline that integration tests run against the real dev API with real dev data, and verify real side effects.

## Where connection details live

The OpenSpec `design.md` for the change must include a `## Dev Environment` section with:

- Base URL of the dev API.
- Auth strategy (test user creds, service token, signed JWT).
- Database connection (read-only? read-write? which schema?).
- Queue / cache / object store endpoints.
- Cleanup strategy (test data prefix, transactional rollback, scheduled sweep).

Tests read these from the design artifact — never hard-code in test files.

## What "integration" means here

- The system under test (the backend service / module) runs against its REAL dependencies in the dev environment: real DB, real queues, real cache, real auth.
- Mock ONLY:
  - Truly external third parties (payment processors, email providers) — and only when the dev env doesn't have a sandbox.
  - Non-deterministic inputs (time, randomness, cloud-region routing) when assertion would otherwise flake.
- Everything else is real.

## Full-run enumeration — the whole dev suite

When this discipline runs as a FULL integration pass — the `architect-team-pipeline` Phase 5 cross-layer run, the `mini-review-sweep` batch — and the target codebase carries `<e2e-dir>/suite-manifest.json`, ENUMERATE that manifest and run the ENTIRE dev project: every registered entry, not only the tests belonging to the slice under test. The manifest is the registry of which tests exist (`playwright-suite-builder` owns its contract), and a full run that re-runs only the current slice's tests is a slice run wearing a full run's name — it cannot see the regression the slice caused elsewhere, which is the failure a full run exists to catch. Failures route as solution requirements exactly as today. Absent a suite manifest, behavior is unchanged — run the slice's integration tests as this skill otherwise describes.

## Test structure

### Setup phase

- Create dev data with a per-test prefix (e.g., `it-<test_name>-<uuid>`) to make cleanup automatic and prevent cross-test contamination.
- Authenticate using the dev environment's test-user mechanism (NOT the production auth flow).

### Action phase

- One HTTP request per assertion when possible. Use `httpx` (or the project's existing async client).
- Capture the full request (method, URL, headers minus secrets, body) and response (status, headers, body) on failure for debug.

### Assertion phase

Four layers, all required for any state-changing endpoint:

1. **Response shape (the write echo).** Status code + response body matches the schema in the design artifact. Use a schema validator (pydantic, marshmallow, zod-equivalent) — don't assert one field at a time.
2. **API read-back.** For any written value that is subsequently readable, GET the resource back **through the public API** and assert the written value returns. This layer is required, not optional polish: a write echo can be assembled from the request the caller just sent while the serializer, the response schema, or the read query drops the field entirely — the write succeeds, the read returns nothing, and every other layer is green. For an update endpoint the full chain is required — **POST-echo → GET → PUT-echo → GET-after-PUT** — because the create path and the update path can diverge in exactly the serializer that hides the bug. Assert the value the API RETURNS, never the value you sent.
3. **Side-effect verification (necessary, and not sufficient).** The action actually changed the system:
   - DB row exists / updated / deleted (query directly).
   - Queue message published (consume from the queue or query the broker's API).
   - File written (read from the object store).
   - Cache entry set/invalidated.
   This layer proves the write PERSISTED; it does not prove the value is RETRIEVABLE. **A row the API never returns is a blank field to the user.** A direct-DB assertion is never a substitute for layer 2 — it is the corroboration that layer 2's read-back reflects real stored state rather than a cache or a request echo.
4. **Audit/log effect** where applicable (audit trail row, log line, metric increment).

### Teardown phase

- Clean up the per-test prefix.
- If the test wrote to an external service that doesn't honor prefixes, register the resource with the cleanup registry so a periodic sweep removes it.

## Idempotency

Every test must be runnable twice in a row without failing on the second run. If the first run created data, the second run's setup must either reuse-or-recreate, or the teardown must have removed it.

This is non-negotiable — flaky tests rot the whole suite.

## Per-test expectations & failure handling

For every integration test (local OR live-dev), write a per-step expectation file BEFORE running the test, per `root-cause-test-failures`. The expectation file (`<test-output-dir>/expectations/<test-id>.json`) captures the request payload, response assertions (status / shape / values), **API read-back assertions (the value a subsequent GET must return — the full POST-echo → GET → PUT-echo → GET-after-PUT chain for update endpoints)**, side-effect assertions (DB rows, queue messages, files), and audit-log assertions — all four assertion layers mandated above. The read-back leg is the one most easily dropped here, and dropping it is exactly how a green suite ships a field the API never returns: this file is written BEFORE the test runs and decides what the test asserts. On any failure, do NOT propose a fix until the 3-pass root-cause loop has run and produced an evidence-backed `rca/<test-id>-<ts>.json` artifact. "It's probably flaky" is forbidden — either identify the race / fixture / env trigger with evidence and document the fix in-loop, OR (when the verdict is `product-bug`) escalate via the RCA handoff AND write a solution requirement to `<cwd>/.architect-team/solution-requirements/SR-<test-id>-<ts>.json` per `team-spawning-and-review-gates`'s `## Solution Requirements` section. The SR auto-spawns a fix team via the orchestrator; the loop re-enters Phase 2 with the failing integration test as the convergence check.

## Test naming

- Pattern: `test_<endpoint>_<scenario>` (e.g., `test_post_projects_creates_with_owner`, `test_post_projects_401_when_unauthenticated`).
- One scenario per test. Don't bundle happy-path and error cases in one function.

## Error path coverage

Cover EVERY error response the endpoint can return, drawn from the OpenSpec design artifact's response catalog:

- 400 / 422 validation errors (one test per failing validation rule).
- 401 unauthenticated.
- 403 unauthorized (right user, wrong role / missing permission).
- 404 not-found.
- 409 conflict.
- 429 rate-limited.
- 5xx via fault injection where possible.

## Anti-pattern rationalizations to reject

| Rationalization | Rebuttal |
|---|---|
| "I'll mock the DB to make the test fast" | Mocking the DB tests your assumptions about the ORM, not your code. Use the real DB in dev. |
| "The error responses are obvious — happy path is enough" | Error paths break production. Coverage of every documented error response is the bar. |
| "I'll skip side-effect verification — the 200 is enough" | A 200 with no side effect is a silent data-loss bug. Verify the row, the message, the file — AND read the value back through the API. The side-effect layer corroborates the read-back; it never replaces it. |
| "The DB row proves it persisted" | Persisted is not retrievable. The user reads through the API; assert there. A green DB assertion beside a serializer that drops the field is exactly the shape of a "fixed" bug the user still sees. |
| "Test data leaks are fine — dev gets reset" | Cross-test contamination causes flaky tests. Use the prefix discipline. |
| "I'll hard-code the dev URL" | The design artifact is the source. Read from it, so changing environments doesn't require a code edit. |
