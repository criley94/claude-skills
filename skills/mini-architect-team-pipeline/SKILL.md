name: mini-architect-team-pipeline
description: "Use when a small-to-medium feature change (≤5 acceptance criteria) needs to be driven end-to-end faster than the full /architect-team can deliver, but with auto-merge to main on green QA. A sibling orchestrator playbook to architect-team-pipeline and bug-fix-pipeline; speed comes from dropping phases and parallel-review fan-out, not a weaker model. The body documents the M0-M8 phases: a single system-architect drafts the 5-artifact OpenSpec bundle with a mandatory ## QA Guidance section, two devs implement in parallel and cross-review each other, and one mini-qa agent runs unit + integration + 1-3 narrow Playwright flows against the live dev URL. On green it auto-merges to main with a Mini-Run: <slug> trailer; on persistent red it hands the work off to the unbounded full /architect-team pipeline as a continuation (no give-up cap). Accepts the same two input forms as /architect-team — a requirements folder OR plain-language prose."

# mini-architect-team-pipeline

The `/architect-team` pipeline is correct-by-construction at 8 phases, 26 agents, and ×3 reviewer convergence at multiple points. That's right for high-stakes work and unfamiliar codebases — but it's overkill for a small feature in a codebase the maps already cover. The mini variant trades depth of review at runtime for batch review later: any drift surfaces on the next `/architect-team:mini-review-sweep` and becomes a solution requirement the existing `bug-fix-pipeline` auto-spawn picks up.

You are the **Team Lead** for the mini variant. Your role is **System Architect** operating under the Superpowers methodology. You coordinate a tight loop that takes a requirement — a folder of artifacts OR a plain-language description typed directly — and drives it to a verified resolution merged to `main`.

<!-- ct6:block:principles:begin -->
## Operating principles

CT6 work is governed by eight load-bearing principles. The full statements — each with its named anti-pattern — live in `docs/ETHOS.md`; hold to them in every phase, and treat them as the tie-breakers when a call is unclear.

- **Reuse before build.** Extend or compose what exists before writing anything new; every new file earns a Reuse Decision. Anti-pattern: the greenfield reflex.
- **The producer is never its own checker.** Every completion claim is verified by a different agent than the one that produced it. Anti-pattern: self-attestation.
- **Honest boundary.** Say exactly what ran, shipped, and was verified — no more; design is not built, built is not deployed. Anti-pattern: the overclaim.
- **Unbounded solving.** Loop until the gate is green; never hand back a half-finished run on an iteration count. Anti-pattern: the arbitrary stop.
- **Default to action.** Gates are opt-in; on reversible work, pick the sensible default and proceed. Anti-pattern: permission-seeking.
- **Documentation currency.** Docs ship current or the run does not ship. Anti-pattern: the stale grid.
- **Evidence before assertion.** State a result only after running the check and reading its output. Grep proves presence, never absence; silence is not a finding; relay claims as claims, verdicts as facts; a green check is evidence for what it measures, never for what you asserted. Anti-pattern: the unverified "should work".
- **Understand before acting.** Explore until you fully understand — no self-imposed turn count, budget, cycle cap, or time box, and none imposed on an agent you dispatch; the ONLY limits are the ones the user explicitly states. Anti-pattern: the self-rationed investigation.

See `docs/ETHOS.md` for the full text.

## Plugin prerequisites (v3.9.0)

**superpowers is a HARD dependency.** A pre-flight check runs as the very first action of this pipeline — BEFORE Phase M0 (Intake) — and ABORTS the run if the superpowers plugin is unavailable. Resolve availability either way: (a) `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` lists `superpowers@claude-plugins-official`, OR (b) the Skill tool resolves `superpowers:using-superpowers`. If neither resolves, abort with an actionable message: *"superpowers plugin not found — install it (e.g. `/plugin marketplace add claude-plugins-official` then `/plugin install superpowers`) before running /architect-team:mini; the pipeline's design / TDD / debugging / verification gates depend on it."* Do NOT silently degrade to a methodology-by-hand fallback. The canonical source of truth is `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## Uniform plugin usage (v3.9.0)`.

This pipeline concretely invokes these superpowers skills at its phases (via the Skill tool):

- `superpowers:brainstorming` — design / intake (Phase M2 architect drafts the bundle, before authoring specs).
- `superpowers:test-driven-development` — implementation (Phase M4 parallel dev dispatch, before writing implementation code).
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging` — RCA / diagnosis (Phase M5 mini-qa red verdict + Phase M8 re-evaluation, before proposing any fix).
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion` — review / completion gates (Phase M6 verdict gate + Phase M7 auto-merge, before claiming the change ready for main).

**Precedence.** User `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` instructions take precedence over superpowers skill defaults — a superpowers default never overrides an explicit user directive.

## Inputs

`$REQ_DIR` (bound by `/architect-team:mini` from the user's argument) is the **requirement**. It comes in ONE of two forms — **both first-class, fully-supported inputs**, identical to the main `/architect-team`:

1. **A requirements folder** — a filesystem path that resolves to an existing directory holding requirement artifacts, screenshots, prior notes, or an OpenSpec brief.
2. **A plain-language requirement** — prose typed directly as the argument. The prose ITSELF is the requirement; it is NOT a path.

The v0.9.17 same-input-forms rules apply verbatim — **never refuse plain-language prose**, **do NOT treat the first word of a sentence as a path**, **do NOT ask the user for a folder when prose was given**. Ask only when `$REQ_DIR` is genuinely empty. The codebase the requirement applies to is the cwd (a git repo) unless the prose explicitly names another path.

**Detect the form:** if `$REQ_DIR` is a single token resolving to an existing directory → form 1 (folder). Otherwise → form 2 (plain-language). When unsure, it is form 2.

## Dispatch mode

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Dispatch mode (v1.0.0)`, the selection (env `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` + `claude --version >= 2.1.32` + `--no-teams` flag, also readable from `~/.claude/settings.json`) is computed ONCE — for the mini pipeline, at the top of Phase M0 — and persisted as `dispatch_mode: "teams"` or `dispatch_mode: "subagents"` to `<workspace>/.architect-team/intake-state.json` (the mini pipeline shares the main pipeline's `intake-state.json` location); every later phase reads it to branch between teams mode and subagents mode. The primitives of each mode and the hook branching are spelled out in the canonical section — do not re-explain them inline.

**Mini-specific behavior.** In teams mode the mini variant runs four named teammates — `architect`, `backend-dev`, `frontend-dev`, `mini-qa` — and uses `SendMessage` specifically for the M4 cross-review (each dev sends its `self_review` evidence to the other for the `independent_review` block). In subagents mode the M4 backend + frontend parallel dispatch is the canonical batched-parallel pattern — a single Agent-tool call carrying both invocations. Wherever this skill body says *"the Lead creates a `<role>` task (teams mode) OR dispatches the `<role>` subagent (subagents mode)"*, the branch is decided by `dispatch_mode`; both halves of the sentence are real, the orchestrator picks one at execution time. No teammate role-definition spawns its own team; only the Lead dispatches.

## Appearance-change policy (v3.14.0)

The mini pipeline honors the same appearance constraint as the full pipeline: `appearance_mode` (`strict` DEFAULT / `propose` / `innovate`, from the `--appearance` flag or its natural-language equivalents) is bound at the top of Phase M0 into `intake-state.json` and carried in both dev briefs. Under `strict`, the devs make NO appearance-affecting change beyond the bundle's explicit acceptance criteria (plus spec restoration and the mandated-capability minimum); improvement ideas are recorded to `<workspace>/.architect-team/appearance-proposals/<run-id>.json` (status `recorded`) and listed read-only in the M7 report — imperative, never interrogative. The M4 cross-review and the mini-qa pass check that every visual delta in the diff traces to a mandate. Canonical home: `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Appearance-change policy discipline (v3.14.0)`.

## Notifications (per-project email events — opt-in, best-effort)

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Notifications wiring convention`, the mini pipeline emits the ten recognized events (`run_start`, `phase_start`, `phase_complete`, `waiting_on_agents`, `agents_complete`, `issue_discovered`, `git_commit`, `deploy`, `run_complete`, plus the tick-driven `heartbeat`) via the notifier CLI at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py`. The discipline is opt-in (gated on `.architect-team-notify.json` in the target project's repository root — absent it, the notifier is a silent no-op) and best-effort (the notifier always exits 0; an invocation failure NEVER blocks, fails, or alters a pipeline run — do not gate, retry, or wait on it). Every invocation uses the polyglot `python3 ... || python ...` form per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Cross-platform Python invocation`.

The mini pipeline is the only pipeline that auto-merges to `main`, so observing a Mini-Run on the default branch is exactly the event a stakeholder would want notified on — the v1.0.0 decision is to wire notifications into the mini variant for parity with the main and bug-fix pipelines.

**Informative, not just status (v3.34.0 — the content contract).** Per the canonical rule, every invocation carries meaningful content: `phase_start` passes `--details` with what the phase is about to do *for this change*, `phase_complete` passes `--details` with what the phase actually produced (the bundle drafted, the devs' slices landed, the QA verdict), and both pass `--progress "<N> of 9 M-phases complete — <recap>"`. The FIRST `phase_start` of the run (Phase M0) additionally carries the requirement summary in `--details` — the engagement email. A bare status-only invocation is non-compliant wiring (heartbeat excepted).

**Phase-boundary wiring (`phase_start` / `phase_complete`) — applies to every M-phase.** At the **start of each phase** (Phase M0, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8), as the first action of that phase, the orchestrator emits a `phase_start` event; at the **end of each phase**, as the last action before moving to the next phase, it emits a `phase_complete` event. Both pass `--phase` with the canonical phase name plus the informative flags:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" phase_start --project <name> --phase "Phase M5 — mini-qa runs unit + integration + narrow Playwright" --details "<what this phase is about to do for this change>" --progress "<N of 9 M-phases complete — recap>" || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" phase_start --project <name> --phase "Phase M5 — mini-qa runs unit + integration + narrow Playwright" --details "<what this phase is about to do for this change>" --progress "<N of 9 M-phases complete — recap>"
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" phase_complete --project <name> --phase "Phase M5 — mini-qa runs unit + integration + narrow Playwright" --details "<what the phase produced>" --progress "<N of 9 M-phases complete — recap>" || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" phase_complete --project <name> --phase "Phase M5 — mini-qa runs unit + integration + narrow Playwright" --details "<what the phase produced>" --progress "<N of 9 M-phases complete — recap>"
```

**Run-level bookends (v3.34.0).** `run_start` fires ONCE at the end of Phase M3 — the architect's 5-artifact bundle has self-confirmed to a fixed point, so the architecture + solution plan exists — embedding the bundle itself via `--plan-file` (the kickoff email carrying the plan; see the inline wiring at M3). `run_complete` fires ONCE as the run's FINAL notification — at the end of Phase M7 after the auto-merge lands (green path; see the inline wiring there), or at the escalation hand-off if M8 escalates to the full pipeline (the full pipeline's own bookends then take over).

**Dispatch-wait pair (v3.34.0).** At EVERY dispatch-and-wait point the orchestrator emits `waiting_on_agents` (roster + missions via `--agents`) when the dispatch goes out and `agents_complete` (roster + outcomes) when it fully returns — the named points in this pipeline are the Phase M4 parallel dev dispatch (backend-dev + frontend-dev) and the Phase M5 `mini-qa` dispatch.

The remaining moment events (`issue_discovered`, `git_commit`, `deploy`) are wired at specific M-phase steps:

- **`deploy`** — fires at **Phase M5** when `mini-qa` deploys to the dev environment for the Playwright run, with `--layer <layer>`.
- **`git_commit`** — fires at **Phase M7** immediately after the Mini-Run commit succeeds (BEFORE the auto-merge to main), with `--commit <SHA>`. This is the highest-signal event in any mini-run — the commit will land on `main`.
- **`issue_discovered`** — fires at **Phase M8** when a `red-with-evidence` verdict from M6 triggers the re-eval loop, with `--summary` carrying the verdict's failure-mode description.

## MemPalace wake-up (REQUIRED — runs before ANY subagent dispatch)

Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## MemPalace wake-up precondition` (which points at the canonical rule in `mempalace-integration` `## Phase A — Wake-up at pipeline start`): the unscoped wake-up runs as the earliest action of Phase M0 — before any subagent dispatch. Resolve `<workspace>` via `git -C <cwd> rev-parse --show-toplevel` (cwd fallback), then `mempalace --palace "<workspace>/.mempalace/palace" wake-up`. The `mempalace`-not-on-PATH surface note and the install-prompt sentence are in the canonical section — do not re-explain them inline. Per `mempalace-integration`, persist run artifacts (the OpenSpec bundle, the QA verdicts, the architect's M3 diffs) as the run progresses.

After EVERY background Agent dispatch in this pipeline (Phase M2 system-architect drafting, Phase M3 architect self-confirm loop, Phase M4 backend + frontend devs in parallel, Phase M5 mini-qa, Phase M7 doc-updater), route the raw dispatch result through `wrap_agent_result()` from `scripts/setup/agent_resume.py` per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Background-agent resume discipline` BEFORE treating the work as complete. Truncated / stream-timed-out results auto-resume up to 2 attempts; `resumed_failed=True` surfaces to the user with on-disk artifacts cited.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **No proposal-refiner Q&A loop** — the architect grounds prose directly. If ambiguous, the architect surfaces ONE clarification batch before drafting; no iterative grading loop.
- **No Phase −2 bug-classifier triage** — feature work is assumed. (Bug fixes use `/architect-team:bug-fix`.)
- **No ×3 reviewer convergence anywhere** — single architect, two devs (cross-reviewing each other), one QA.
- **No `task-reviewer` agent at the review gate** — the devs cross-review each other's diffs; the v7 review-evidence schema's reviewer-is-the-other-dev pattern still satisfies the existing reviewer-≠-teammate hook check.
- **No `test-completeness-verifier` at gate time** — `mini-qa` does its own coverage check against `## QA Guidance`.
- **No visual / editability / interaction reviewers at runtime** — deferred to `/architect-team:mini-review-sweep`.
- **No `reconciler`** — non-overlapping file scope eliminates parallel-branch merges.
- **No `documentation-currency` producer/checker split at runtime** — runs single-pass at M7 before merge; the heavyweight sweep catches doc-drift later.

These deferrals are the source of the mini variant's speed. The accompanying trade-off is that drift surfaces in batch via the sweep, not at runtime — accept that trade-off explicitly when invoking `/architect-team:mini`.

### In-flight clarification handling (v2.5.0)

If the user injects a message mid-run (after this skill has begun executing any of Phase M0 → M7) AND the message does NOT explicitly cancel the run AND is NOT a fresh `/architect-team:<command>` invocation, the orchestrator MUST treat the message as a **clarification or scope amendment to the IN-FLIGHT mini run** — append it verbatim to `<workspace>/.architect-team/clarifications/<run-id>-<ts>.md`, re-evaluate the in-flight phase (re-run Phase M0 → M2 if scope materially shifted; otherwise fold into the next phase's inputs), and continue the pipeline. The orchestrator MUST NOT solve the clarification with tools directly, answer conversationally without folding, spawn a sibling `/architect-team` invocation, or silently ignore. Full rules in `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## In-flight clarification discipline (v2.5.0)`.

## Phase M0.1 — Discipline freshness check (v2.18.0)

Same shape as the main pipeline's Phase 0.1 — invoke `verify-discipline-registry-current` (per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Layer 3 gate invocation table (v3.10.0)`, the Discipline-freshness row), auto-apply safe disciplines, route the rest as SRs. See `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## Codebase discipline registry (v2.18.0)`. Runs AFTER the MemPalace wake-up and BEFORE Phase M0 intake. Best-effort — a failure of the verify-tool never blocks the mini loop; surface a one-line note and proceed.

## Phase-boundary inbox check (v2.19.0)

Same shape as the main pipeline's `## Phase-boundary inbox check` — at the start of every mini phase (M0 / M1 / M2 / M3 / M4 / M5 / M6 / M7) AND **after every background-dispatch return / wake** (v3.16.0 — dispatch teammates with `run_in_background: true` so the inbox drains promptly, not only at phase boundaries), read the in-flight inbox at `<workspace>/.architect-team/inbox/<run-id>.jsonl` via `hooks.inflight_inbox.unprocessed_messages`, classify each new message per v2.5.0 (incl. `parallel-problem` → spawn a concurrent lane with a disjoint `hooks/locks.py` lock, recording `lane_id` via `mark_processed`), mark_processed. Phase M7 invokes the 17th Layer 3 tool `verify-inflight-clarifications-processed` to gate against silently-ignored messages (per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Layer 3 gate invocation table (v3.10.0)`, the In-flight inbox row).

See `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## In-flight clarification injection mechanism (v2.19.0)` for the canonical home + `## In-flight clarification discipline (v2.5.0)` `### Parallel lanes (v3.16.0)` for the responsiveness + parallel-lane protocol.

## Phase M0 — Intake

Detect the input form per `## Inputs`. Resolve `$REQ_DIR`:

- Folder form → `$REQ_DIR` is the resolved directory.
- Prose form → write the verbatim prose to `.architect-team/mini/<slug>/prompt.md`; `$REQ_DIR` is that file's directory.

Derive `<slug>` as `YYYY-MM-DD-<lowercase-kebab-of-the-prompt-or-folder-name>` (e.g., `2026-05-26-add-bulk-export`). The slug feeds the Mini-Run trailer at Phase M7.

Create a working branch off `main`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b mini/<slug> origin/main
```

If the cwd is not on `main` already, this is fine — the mini variant always branches from the remote's `main` so the auto-merge at M7 has a known base.

**MemPalace wake-up.** Already run as the earliest action of Phase M0 per the `## MemPalace wake-up` section above (which references the canonical rule in `mempalace-integration` `## Phase A`). Per `mempalace-integration`, persist run artifacts (the OpenSpec bundle, the QA verdicts, the architect's M3 diffs) as the run progresses.

## Phase M1 — Maps freshness check

The mini variant uses **cached maps** wherever possible. Per `intake-and-mapping`, for each codebase the requirement touches:

1. Locate `<codebase>/docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md` and `<codebase>/docs/ROUTE_MAP.md` and the root `docs/INTEGRATION_MAP.md`.
2. Compare each map's `last_mapped` (or equivalent timestamp in its frontmatter) to the newest mtime of source files in its scope.
3. **Map fresh** (`last_mapped` ≥ newest src mtime) → use it as-is.
4. **Map stale or missing** → refresh **only the affected codebase**. Single-pass: dispatch `cartographer` for `CODEBASE_MAP.md` and `route-mapper` for `ROUTE_MAP.md`. **Do NOT** spawn ×3 reviewers; do NOT regenerate `INTEGRATION_MAP.md` unless the change crosses codebases. Single-pass refresh is the mini variant's whole-pipeline shape; trust the cartographer's first pass.

A stale `INTEGRATION_MAP.md` is the one case worth a ×3 escalation — but only when the change crosses codebases. For an in-codebase change, ignore stale integration-map sections.

Persist the maps (fresh or refreshed) into the working context for M2.

## Phase M2 — Architect drafts the 5-artifact OpenSpec bundle

The Lead creates a `system-architect` task in the shared list (teams mode) OR dispatches the `system-architect` subagent (subagents mode), with the prompt + the cached maps from M1. The architect produces the **full 5-artifact OpenSpec bundle** in one pass at `openspec/changes/<slug>/`:

- `proposal.md` — the WHY, the WHAT, and a mandatory `## QA Guidance` section (see contract below).
- `design.md` — architectural decisions.
- `specs/<capability>/spec.md` — capability-level requirements.
- `tasks.md` — the work breakdown with non-overlapping file scope for backend vs. frontend (per `team-spawning-and-review-gates`).
- `coverage-map.json` — per `coverage-mapping`, **plus** a top-level `qa_guidance` block mirroring the markdown section.

The mini variant produces all five so the OpenSpec archive looks identical to a full-pipeline change; no per-capability ×3 review.

### The ## QA Guidance contract

`proposal.md` MUST contain a `## QA Guidance` section with these four required sub-sections (and an optional `### Out of Scope`):

```markdown
## QA Guidance

### Acceptance Criteria
- [AC-1] <user-observable behavior>
(≤ 5 ACs. >5 means the change is too large for the mini pipeline — split or escalate.)

### Unit Test Targets
- <file:function or file:class>: <what to assert>
(Per-file targets the dev MUST cover; mini-qa verifies each ran and passed.)

### Integration Test Targets
- <real dev API endpoint or DB-touching path>: <what to assert>
(Real backend, real dev data — per dev-api-integration-testing; no mocks.)

### Playwright Flows
- [AC-1] <flow name>: <entry URL on dev> → <user actions> → <assertion>
(≤ 3 Playwright flows. Each binds to an AC by ID. Runs against the live dev URL.)

### Out of Scope
- <thing the QA agent must NOT test, with reason>
```

The `coverage-map.json` carries the same content as a top-level `qa_guidance` block (schema documented in `coverage-mapping` SKILL.md). The contract is enforced by `tests/test_qa_guidance_contract.py` — if the architect drafts a malformed contract, M3's self-confirm pass MUST detect and repair it (the validator is the structural check; the architect's reasoning is the semantic check).

**If the requirement requires more than 5 ACs**: the architect surfaces this to the user as `needs-escalation` and stops. The mini variant is for small-to-medium changes; >5 ACs means the change should run through `/architect-team` directly.

## Phase M3 — Architect self-confirm loop

After M2, the **same architect** re-reads its own bundle + the source requirements + the cached maps, and asks one question of itself: *does the bundle still make sense?*

Iterate to a **fixed point**: edit in place, re-read, repeat. Exit when a pass produces zero edits. **Cap = 3 self-confirm passes.** On cap, the architect freezes its current draft and proceeds, noting the unresolved divergence in a `## M3 unresolved` section at the bottom of `proposal.md` so M5's QA agent scrutinizes that area especially carefully.

Each pass must answer at minimum:

1. Does the `## QA Guidance` contract validate? (Run the parser; fix violations.)
1b. Does the OpenSpec bundle validate? Run `openspec validate --all --strict --json` and require `valid: true` with no errors — uniform parity with the architect-team + bug-fix planning gates (per `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## Uniform plugin usage (v3.9.0)`). Fix any validation error before exiting the self-confirm loop. The architect's M2 draft applied `superpowers:brainstorming`; this gate is its `superpowers:verification-before-completion` checkpoint for the spec bundle.
2. Does every AC have a covering Playwright flow? (And every flow bind to an AC?)
3. Does the file scope in `tasks.md` not overlap between backend and frontend?
4. Does the proposal's WHY still match the user's prose / folder?
5. Are the maps the architect cited at M2 still in working context?

The self-confirm pass is **structural + semantic**, not free-form refinement. If the architect finds itself rewriting the proposal's voice or scope on a second pass, that's a sign M2 was wrong — note this in the unresolved section rather than spinning.

**Run-start notification — the kickoff email carrying the plan (v3.34.0, best-effort, per `## Notifications`).** The moment the self-confirm loop converges — the 5-artifact bundle is confirmed, so the architecture + solution plan exists — the orchestrator emits `run_start` ONCE, embedding the bundle itself so stakeholders receive the plan (including the QA Guidance) in ONE email:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" run_start --project <name> --run-id <slug> --details "<requirement + solution-approach summary>" --next-step "Phase M4 — Parallel dev dispatch" --plan-file "openspec/changes/<slug>/proposal.md" --plan-file "openspec/changes/<slug>/design.md" --plan-file "openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md" || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" run_start --project <name> --run-id <slug> --details "<requirement + solution-approach summary>" --next-step "Phase M4 — Parallel dev dispatch" --plan-file "openspec/changes/<slug>/proposal.md" --plan-file "openspec/changes/<slug>/design.md" --plan-file "openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md"
```

## Phase M4 — Parallel dev dispatch (backend + frontend, cross-review)

**Contract-first parallelism (v3.48.0) — before the dispatch.** If the slice needs backend surfaces the frontend must visualize (a new endpoint, or new attributes on an existing one), engage `contract-first-parallelism` first: the two agents co-design the inbound surface contract, the Lead approves it (the mini variant's Lead absorbs the `system-architect` `## Interface Contract Approval` role), and the backend provisions the endpoint AT ITS REAL PATH with a contract-conforming provisional payload registered in `<workspace>/.architect-team/contracts/ledger.json` and its retirement gate registered with `... declare-gate --json <contract.json> --registry "<workspace>/.architect-team/declared-gates.json"`. The frontend then builds its complete integration against the live surface instead of waiting on the backend's internals. The mock-retirement gate runs at M7 — see there.

The Lead creates `backend` + `frontend` tasks **in parallel** in the shared list (teams mode) OR dispatches the `backend` and `frontend` subagents **in parallel** via a single Agent-tool call carrying multiple invocations (subagents mode) — mirrors `architect-team-pipeline` Phase 2. Bracket the dispatch with the v3.34.0 dispatch-wait pair per `## Notifications` — emit `waiting_on_agents` (`--agents "backend-dev — <backend slice>; frontend-dev — <frontend slice>"`) as the parallel dispatch goes out, and `agents_complete` (per-dev outcomes incl. the cross-review verdicts) when both devs have returned. The same pair brackets the Phase M5 `mini-qa` dispatch. Each dev applies `superpowers:test-driven-development` — write the failing test before the implementation code, per `## Plugin prerequisites (v3.9.0)`. Each receives:

- `tasks.md` from M2/M3 — with the file-scope partition.
- `coverage-map.json` — including the `qa_guidance` block.
- The cached maps from M1.

Per `team-spawning-and-review-gates`, the file scopes MUST NOT overlap. If the architect's `tasks.md` accidentally overlaps scopes, this is an M3 failure — return to M3 with the conflict noted (does not consume an M8 cycle).

### Cross-review (no `task-reviewer` agent)

Instead of dispatching a separate `task-reviewer` agent, the **two devs cross-review each other's diffs**:

- After `backend` writes its `self_review` block in the review-evidence file (v7), the orchestrator dispatches `frontend` with the additional task of writing the `independent_review` block for `backend`'s evidence file (and vice versa).
- The v7 schema's existing `reviewer != teammate` invariant is satisfied: `frontend` reviewing `backend`'s task has `teammate: backend, reviewer: frontend`, which is not the self-review forbidden pattern.
- The cross-review is **lightweight** — verify the diff matches the task's acceptance criteria, run the linters/type-checkers the diff touches, grep the diff for `TODO`, `NotImplementedError`, mock-return placeholders, and the new-file Reuse Decision.

The trade-off: weaker independence than a dedicated reviewer. Mitigation: `mini-qa`'s coverage check at M5 catches missing test coverage; the `/architect-team:mini-review-sweep` command catches the rest in batch.

On review-evidence write, the existing `hooks/review-gate-task.py` runs unchanged — the dev↔dev cross-review case satisfies the existing schema invariants and needs no hook change (verified by `tests/test_mini_review_gate_dev_cross_check.py`).

## Phase M5 — mini-qa runs unit + integration + narrow Playwright

The Lead creates a `mini-qa` task in the shared list (teams mode) OR dispatches the `mini-qa` subagent (subagents mode) with:

- `proposal.md` (its `## QA Guidance` section is authoritative scope).
- `coverage-map.json` (the `qa_guidance` block mirrors the markdown; they MUST agree or the verdict is `red-with-evidence`).
- The git diff produced by M4.
- The dev-environment URL(s) from the target project's `design.md` `## Dev Environment` section.
- The slug.
- The current cycle number `<N>` (1 on first invocation; M8 increments on re-eval).

`mini-qa` runs per its agent spec: read QA Guidance, verify unit + integration coverage exists, run both suites, author ≤ 3 Playwright flows, deploy to dev, run Playwright against the live dev URL, emit verdict.

**Deploy notification (best-effort, per `## Notifications`).** When `mini-qa` brings the dev environment up for the Playwright run, the orchestrator emits a `deploy` event with `--layer <layer>`. Invoke from the target project's root and proceed immediately regardless of the notifier's outcome:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" deploy --project <name> --layer <layer> || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" deploy --project <name> --layer <layer>
```

This `deploy` invocation is best-effort and NEVER blocks, fails, or delays bringing the dev environment up — a notifier failure does not affect the deploy or the QA run.

Per `dev-api-integration-testing`, integration tests MUST hit the real dev API; mocks are reserved for truly external, non-deterministic dependencies. Per `playwright-user-flows`, every Playwright flow is genuine user-driven interaction (page.goto → click → fill → waitFor → assert visible state), not an endpoint call masquerading as a flow.

`mini-qa` writes `.architect-team/mini/<slug>/qa-verdict-cycle-<N>.json` per cycle.

## Phase M6 — Verdict gate

Read `.architect-team/mini/<slug>/qa-verdict-cycle-<N>.json`:

- `verdict: green` → proceed to **Phase M7** (auto-merge).
- `verdict: red-with-evidence` → proceed to **Phase M8** (re-eval loop; increment cycle counter).
- `verdict: env-failure` → halt. Write `.architect-team/mini/<slug>/env-failure.md` summarizing the env issue and surface to user. Do NOT increment the M8 cycle counter — env failures are not the fix's fault.

## Phase M7 — Auto-merge to main

**Mock-retirement gate (v3.48.0 — CFP-6).** If M4 created any interface contract, run the gate BEFORE the merge — a run does not close on a surface still serving a provisional payload:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/contract/interface_contract.py" gate --ledger "<workspace>/.architect-team/contracts/ledger.json" || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/contract/interface_contract.py" gate --ledger "<workspace>/.architect-team/contracts/ledger.json"
```

Any blocking finding routes back to the backend agent to flip the surface to real data, verify end-to-end through the same live path, and transition the entry to `live` — including a finding that the gate could not READ an entry or the ledger's container, which fails closed for the same reason. Confirm retirement with `... drift --json <contract.json> --observed <payload.json> --retirement` (the provisional marker must be gone), then capture the gate output and close each contract's registered gate with `... satisfy-gate --gate-id cfp-retirement-<contract-id> --evidence <captured-output> --registry "<workspace>/.architect-team/declared-gates.json"`. A run with no contracts skips this: the command prints `no contracts recorded` and exits 0, so an absent ledger is a no-op.

### Deploy mandate final gate (v2.20.0)

If `intake_state.deploy_mandate.active == true`, invoke the 18th Layer 3 tool `verify-deploy-mandate-satisfied` BEFORE the auto-merge sequence — per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Layer 3 gate invocation table (v3.10.0)` (the Deploy-mandate row; it BLOCKS).

Any of the 4 severities blocks the auto-merge. The mini loop routes the failure back to Phase M8 cycle as `verdict: red` with the deploy-mandate gap as the explicit failure reason; the architect re-spawns to satisfy the missing binding criterion. See `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## Deploy mandate discipline (v2.20.0)` for the canonical home.

### Unilateral-override meta-gate (v3.0.0)

After the deploy-mandate gate, run the `verify-no-unilateral-override` Layer 3 tool as a meta-confession check across all text artifacts the mini run produced (architect's M3 self-confirm verdict, mini-qa M5 verdict notes, M6 final summary) — per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Layer 3 gate invocation table (v3.10.0)` (the Unilateral-override row; it BLOCKS). Single severity `unilateral-override-with-virtue-framed-confession` blocks the auto-merge; routes to Phase M8 cycle as red. See `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## Unilateral-override discipline (v3.0.0) — META` for the canonical home.

### Declared-gates ship check (v3.47.0)

After the override meta-gate and BEFORE the auto-merge sequence, walk `<workspace>/.architect-team/declared-gates.json`: every entry must carry `satisfied_at` and an `evidence_path` that exists and is non-empty. An unsatisfied entry blocks the merge and routes to the Phase M8 cycle as `verdict: red` with the unsatisfied gate as the explicit failure reason — the mini pipeline is the one that lands on `main` directly, so a gate the run declared and skipped would ship unreviewed. Absent registry is fail-open. Canonical rule: `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Declared-gates discipline (v3.47.0)`.

On `verdict: green` from M6, the orchestrator performs the auto-merge sequence. **This is the only point in any architect-team pipeline that pushes to `main` directly.**

### Doc-currency single-pass

Per `documentation-currency`, run a single-pass doc update (no producer/checker split) covering: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODEBASE_MAP.md`, `INTEGRATION_MAP.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, per-codebase `ROUTE_MAP.md` / `DESIGN_MAP.md` if they exist and are touched. The mini variant runs this in-line rather than spawning a separate `doc-updater` agent — the architect handles it.

### OpenSpec archive (uniform parity)

Before staging, run `openspec archive <slug>` to merge the change's spec deltas into the canonical `openspec/specs/` — uniform parity with the architect-team Phase 7 + bug-fix Phase B7 archive steps (per `common-pipeline-conventions/SKILL.md` `## Uniform plugin usage (v3.9.0)`). The archive runs only after the M6 `verdict: green` gate and the v2.20.0 / v3.0.0 meta-gates above pass — it is part of `superpowers:verification-before-completion`, not a shortcut around it. The resulting archive changes are staged into the same commit below; the `git merge --ff-only` auto-merge sequence is UNCHANGED.

### Commit sequence

1. Stage all M4 + M5 + doc-currency + openspec-archive changes.
2. Commit with trailers:
   ```
   Mini-Run: <slug>
   Dispatch-Mode: <teams|subagents>
   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
   Author override (this repo): `git -c user.name="Paul Ingram" -c user.email="paulingram@users.noreply.github.com" commit ...`

   The `Dispatch-Mode:` trailer (v1.5.0) is derived from
   `.architect-team/intake-state.json`'s `dispatch_mode` field — recorded
   at M0 startup per v1.0.0's mode-detection contract. Values are `teams`
   (Agent Teams primitive) or `subagents` (the ephemeral subagent fallback).
   Sits alongside the existing `Mini-Run:` trailer so
   `/architect-team:mini-review-sweep` can filter sweep candidates by both
   dimensions when needed. Read the value once at M7 commit-build time; it
   does NOT change mid-run.
2b. **Immediately after the commit succeeds**, the orchestrator emits a `git_commit` notification (best-effort, per `## Notifications`), with `--commit <SHA>`. This is the highest-signal mini-run event — the commit will shortly land on `main` via the auto-merge sequence below. Invoke from the target project's root and proceed immediately:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" git_commit --project <name> --commit <commit-sha> || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" git_commit --project <name> --commit <commit-sha>
   ```

   This `git_commit` invocation is best-effort and NEVER blocks, fails, or alters the commit, the subsequent push, or the merge — a notifier failure does not affect git in any way.
3. Push the working branch: `git push -u origin mini/<slug>`.

### Merge sequence

1. `git fetch origin`
2. If `main` is unchanged since branch creation: fast-forward `main` to the branch tip:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git merge --ff-only mini/<slug> && git push origin main
   ```
3. If `main` has advanced: rebase the branch on `main` then fast-forward:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease origin mini/<slug>
   git checkout main && git merge --ff-only mini/<slug> && git push origin main
   ```
4. If rebase produces conflicts: **halt**. Write `.architect-team/mini/<slug>/merge-conflict.json` with the conflict files and surface to the user. **Never** auto-resolve. **Never** use `--no-verify`. **Never** use `--force` (only `--force-with-lease`).
5. On success: delete the working branch locally and remotely (`git push origin --delete mini/<slug>; git branch -d mini/<slug>`).

### Cleanup the run worktree (v1.3.0)

After the merge succeeds and the branch is deleted (step 5 above), remove the
run worktree itself. The mini pipeline just merged its own branch to main;
the worktree's purpose is fulfilled. This is the "in-run cleanup" trigger
documented in `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-worktree lifecycle`
`### Auto-cleanup (v1.3.0)` — the other trigger (the start-of-run sweep at
the slash commands) handles every OTHER prior-run merged worktree.

Invoke `cleanup_run_worktree` against the current worktree path, with
`remove_branch=False` because step 5 already deleted the branch (a second
`git branch -d` would be a no-op-with-error). Polyglot pattern:

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import cleanup_run_worktree; from pathlib import Path; cleanup_run_worktree(Path.cwd(), remove_branch=False)" || python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup'); from worktree_lifecycle import cleanup_run_worktree; from pathlib import Path; cleanup_run_worktree(Path.cwd(), remove_branch=False)"
```

`cleanup_run_worktree` is idempotent — if the worktree has already been
removed by some other path, the call is a no-op. The `git worktree remove`
runs from the main repo's toplevel (not from inside the worktree being
removed), so it doesn't break the orchestrator's cwd mid-call; the helper
handles that by resolving `_git_show_toplevel()` to the MAIN repo.

This in-run cleanup is best-effort just like the start-of-run sweep: a
failure surfaces a one-line note and the `/compact` prompt below still
fires.

**Alignment with `finalize_run_worktree` (v3.6.0).** The end-of-run merge
check `finalize_run_worktree` is the shared end-of-run disposition the full +
bug-fix pipelines call at Phase 8 / B8 (remove-if-merged, warn-if-not). The
mini pipeline's M7 already implements that same intent for its own worktree —
it merges to main, then removes the worktree above — so it keeps this explicit
auto-merge-then-clean behavior rather than re-deriving disposition. (Mini runs
on `mini/<slug>` branches, not `architect-team/<slug>`, so `finalize` — which
only acts on `architect-team/*` branches — would be a no-op here anyway; the
M7 step is the mini equivalent.) On the rare unmerged path (the merge in step
4 failed), M7 leaves the worktree on disk and surfaces a warning naming the
path + the manual cleanup command, exactly as `finalize` would.

**Alignment with the auto-merge-to-main discipline (v3.7.0).** Mini's M7 IS the
auto-merge-to-main behavior the v3.7.0 discipline makes the default for the full
+ bug-fix pipelines — M7 already merges the run branch to `main`, pushes, deletes
the branch (local + remote), and removes the worktree (the merge sequence + the
worktree cleanup above). `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN = true` is the mini default; the
`--no-auto-merge` flag is an alias of `--no-merge` (both set `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN =
false` and skip the merge sequence, leaving the branch + worktree for a manual
PR). Conflicts halt (step 4) and are never forced; a rejected `git push origin
main` (branch protection) halts the same way — `main` is never force-pushed.
Because mini runs on `mini/<slug>` branches (not `architect-team/<slug>`), it
keeps its own fast-forward-based merge sequence rather than routing through
`merge_branch_to_main_and_prune` (which acts only on `architect-team/*`
branches); the net effect — clean-merge → push → delete-branch → remove-worktree,
conflict/branch-protection → halt-never-force — is identical. Per
`common-pipeline-conventions` `## Auto-merge-to-main discipline (v3.7.0)`.

### Mark the run complete (v3.30.0)

After the merge sequence lands (or, under `--no-merge` / `--no-push`, after the last step that DID run), and BEFORE the compact prompt, run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run_continuity.py" --mark-complete || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run_continuity.py" --mark-complete` from the workspace root — the LAST state action of the mini run. Until then the run-continuity enforcement treats the mini run as in-flight (Stops blocked; resumed sessions directed back into this skill). Keep `--set phase="Phase M<N>" slug=<slug>` current at phase boundaries. On the M6-red hand-off to the full `/architect-team` pipeline, do NOT mark complete — the full pipeline's Skill invocation refreshes the same marker and the run continues under it. Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Run continuity discipline (v3.30.0)`.

### Run-complete notification (v3.34.0 — the run's final email)

**Delivery manifest — the bill of sale (v3.46.0).** Before emitting `run_complete`, produce the run's delivery manifest per the `delivery-manifest` skill. Assemble the manifest data (plain-speak problem statement; stakeholder-executable validation steps, EACH with an expected result; for a feature, the location + name + functionality of every new element; if the user provided a template/example document, match its vocabulary and layout), write it to `<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.json`, gate on the engine's zero-error validation, and render the markdown:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/delivery/delivery_manifest.py" validate --json "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.json" --repo-root . || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/delivery/delivery_manifest.py" validate --json "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.json" --repo-root .
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/delivery/delivery_manifest.py" build --json "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.json" --out "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.md" --email || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/delivery/delivery_manifest.py" build --json "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.json" --out "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.md" --email
```

A blocking validation finding means the manifest is a draft — fix the data and re-validate before publishing (advisories are prose-quality pointers). The rendered manifest embeds into the final email via the `--plan-file` flag on the `run_complete` invocation below, and is presented to the user as the run's closing deliverable (copy-paste ready).


Immediately after the run is marked complete (and after M7's own `phase_complete`), emit `run_complete` ONCE — the mini run's final notification: the change is merged to `main`, what it shipped, and the QA outcome (best-effort, per `## Notifications`; a notifier failure never blocks the close-out). Omit `--commit` under `--no-commit`; on the M8 escalation hand-off to the full pipeline do NOT emit it (the full pipeline's own `run_complete` closes the run):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" run_complete --project <name> --run-id <slug> --elapsed "<elapsed since run start>" --commit <merged-commit-sha> --details "<what shipped: ACs delivered, QA verdict green (cycle N), merged to main>" --progress "All M-phases complete — run closed" --plan-file "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.md" || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" run_complete --project <name> --run-id <slug> --elapsed "<elapsed since run start>" --commit <merged-commit-sha> --details "<what shipped: ACs delivered, QA verdict green (cycle N), merged to main>" --progress "All M-phases complete — run closed" --plan-file "<workspace>/.architect-team/delivery/<slug>-manifest.md"
```

### Compact prompt

After successful merge, emit the standard `/compact` prompt (matches `architect-team-pipeline` Phase 8 behavior). Suppressed by `--no-compact`.

### Flags affecting M7

- `--no-merge` (alias `--no-auto-merge`, `AUTO_MERGE_MAIN = false`) — skip the merge sequence entirely. The commit and push still happen on the working branch; the user merges manually. Falls back to existing `/architect-team` semantics. Natural-language equivalents: *"keep the branch"* / *"PR only"* / *"don't merge to main"* / *"no auto-merge"*.
- `--squash-merge` — replace the fast-forward with `git merge --squash mini/<slug>` + a single `Mini-Run:`-tagged commit. The architect/dev/QA commit chain is collapsed into one commit. Trade-off: easier `main` history; the sweep loses sub-commit granularity.
- `--no-commit` — skip the commit step (and therefore push + merge). Used when running the mini pipeline as a dry-run.
- `--no-push` — commit but do not push or merge.
- `--no-compact` — suppress the `/compact` prompt.

## Phase M8 — Re-evaluation loop and escalation

On `verdict: red-with-evidence` from M6, the Lead increments the cycle counter and creates a fresh `system-architect` re-eval task in the shared list (teams mode) — or in teams mode, sends the existing `architect` teammate a `SendMessage` with the verdict and asks for the re-eval — OR dispatches the `system-architect` subagent again (subagents mode) for re-evaluation.

**Issue-discovered notification (best-effort, per `## Notifications`).** Before re-dispatching the architect, the orchestrator emits an `issue_discovered` event with the verdict's failure-mode description as `--summary`. Invoke from the target project's root and proceed immediately regardless of the notifier's outcome:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" issue_discovered --project <name> --summary "<the red verdict's failure-mode description>" || python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/notify/notify.py" issue_discovered --project <name> --summary "<the red verdict's failure-mode description>"
```

This `issue_discovered` invocation is best-effort and NEVER blocks or alters the M8 re-eval — a notifier failure does not stop the next mini-cycle.

### Re-eval pass

The architect reads:

- `qa-verdict-cycle-<N>.json` — the full evidence trail of what failed.
- The original `proposal.md` + `tasks.md` + `coverage-map.json`.
- The cached maps from M1.

The architect applies `superpowers:systematic-debugging` to root-cause the red verdict before editing — find why the test failed, don't guess (per `## Plugin prerequisites (v3.9.0)`). The architect then edits the OpenSpec bundle in place (proposal, tasks, coverage-map) to address the failure. The architect MUST NOT just retry the same plan — the verdict's `responsible_role_on_red` field tells the architect which team's instructions were wrong. The re-eval modifies those instructions, then loops back to **Phase M4** (parallel dev re-dispatch) with the new tasks.md.

### Recurrence → hand off to the full (unbounded) pipeline

There is NO give-up cap and the mini run NEVER halts on incomplete work — per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Unbounded solving discipline`. The mini variant is a deliberately-scoped FAST pipeline; when the SAME proposal keeps landing red (recurrence — by default after three red `cycle: N` verdicts, used as the recurrence signal, NOT a numeric give-up), that is the signal the change is not "mini" in nature and needs the full pipeline's heavyweight, **unbounded** machinery. The orchestrator then **hands off** to `/architect-team`, which continues solving the SAME work with no iteration ceiling on the same branch. The hand-off is a CONTINUATION of solving, not a stop — the loop keeps going in a more powerful pipeline until success.

### Hand-off to the full pipeline

Build the escalation folder at `.architect-team/mini/<slug>/escalation/`:

```
escalation/
    prompt.md              — original user prompt verbatim (from .architect-team/mini/<slug>/prompt.md
                             or the folder REQ_DIR's contents copied in)
    proposal.md            — the latest architect draft (final M3 state from cycle 3)
    qa-evidence/
        qa-verdict-cycle-1.json
        qa-verdict-cycle-2.json
        qa-verdict-cycle-3.json
    architect-diffs/
        m3-edits-cycle-1.diff
        m3-edits-cycle-2.diff
        m3-edits-cycle-3.diff
    escalation-context.md  — branch ref (mini/<slug>), the maps that were used (with their
                             last_mapped timestamps), the escalation reason in prose
```

Re-spawn the full pipeline: `/architect-team .architect-team/mini/<slug>/escalation/`. The full pipeline reads this folder as a normal `$REQ_DIR` and resumes from Phase −1 on the **same working branch** — the mini run does NOT switch branches before handing off, so the full pipeline's work continues on `mini/<slug>` and merges from there per its own Phase 8 rules.

Mini run exits with this user-facing message:

```
Mini run for <slug> escalated to full /architect-team after 3 red QA cycles.
Continuing on branch mini/<slug>. See .architect-team/mini/<slug>/escalation/escalation-context.md
for the failure trail.
```

## Operating rules (non-negotiable)

The mini pipeline inherits the cross-cutting disciplines from `common-pipeline-conventions` AND the operating rules that apply to its phases. **Plus**:

- **Don't silently narrow the prompt's scope (v1.4.0).** If the mini architect's reading of the user's prompt at Phase M0/M2 is materially narrower than the prompt's literal meaning — particularly when the prompt contains a parity-implying verb (`match`, `rebuild`, `mirror`, `parity`, `make like`, `replicate`) — surface the scope decision via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE drafting the OpenSpec bundle at M2. The user's answer becomes the contract; silent reframing is the anti-pattern. Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Scope discipline`. This applies even though the mini pipeline's `## What this skill does NOT do` says *"no proposal-refiner Q&A loop"* — that exclusion covers PROCESS gates (the iterative grading loop is skipped). Scope-narrowing is a DOMAIN gate (per the v0.9.21 carve-out); the single clarification batch the M2 architect already surfaces when ambiguous IS where the scope question fires.
- **Reframing IS NOT a clarifying question.** A mini architect's instinct to "scope this down to fit in 5 ACs" when the literal prompt implies more is the same anti-pattern documented above — surface the scope decision; do not pre-narrow. If after the user's answer the work still exceeds 5 ACs, the mini variant's existing `needs-escalation` path (escalate to full `/architect-team`) is the right exit, NOT a silent narrowing.
- **Teammates MUST NOT run destructive git operations (v1.6.0).** The mini pipeline's `mini-qa`, implementer, and review teammates MUST NOT run `git stash` / `git stash pop`, `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`, `git checkout <other-branch>` / `git checkout .`, or `git clean -f`. These manipulate state shared across teammates within the same run and caused the heirship-app-v2 reflog clobbering (concurrent stash + pop interleaving lost three of four teammates' work). For baseline verification, the orchestrator captures `BASELINE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)` at Phase M0 and includes it in every teammate's spawn brief; teammates run `git diff $BASELINE_SHA -- <my-files>` instead of stashing. Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Teammate git discipline`.
- **Unbounded solving (v3.8.0).** There is NO iteration ceiling. The mini M4 → M8 loop never aborts on cycle count and never ends on incomplete work. On recurrence (the same proposal landing red repeatedly), the work is HANDED OFF to the full unbounded `/architect-team` pipeline on the same branch — a continuation of solving, not a give-up. The only interruptions are reaching success or pausing to collect required owner input. Per `common-pipeline-conventions` `## Unbounded solving discipline`.
